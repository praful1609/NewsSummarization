The initial trends showed BJP  leading in all three MCDs - North, South and East.","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has asked its supporters not to celebrate any victories out of respect for the 25 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) who were martyred in a Maoist ambush attack in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district on Monday.The saffron party's appeal comes just ahead of the counting of votes in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) election, which the BJP is expect to win comfortably. The India Today-Axis My India exit poll predicted that the BJP would win as many as 202 to 220 of the 270 wards in which voting took place on Sunday.The poll indicated that the BJP's main rivals, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress, would win 23 to 25 seats, and 19 to 31 seats, respectively.There was more good news for the BJP on Monday, when Delhi University's Developing Countries Research Centre also predicted aÂ  landslide victory for party - led by Manoj Tiwari in the national capital - in all three Delhi corporations.But after communist guerillas on Monday killed over two dozen CRPF bravehearts in Chhatisgarh, the BJP's cadre and followers may not celebrate if these predictions turn out to be accurate.ALSO READ | CRPF, which lost its 25 jawans in Sukma Naxal attack, is without a full-time chief for almost two months nowALSO READ | PM Modi on Sukma attack: Sacrifice of CRPF jawans will not go in vainALSO READ | MCD 2017 exit poll results: India Today-Axis My India predicts big win for BJP, massive setback for AAP, Congress"

'The Fearless Girl' statue says, ""Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference."" It was installed by State Street Global Advisors to encourage companies to increase the number of women directors.","A new statue of a resolute young girl staring down Wall Street's famous Charging Bull was erected by a major asset managing firm for International Women's Day to make a point: There's a dearth of women on the boards of the largest US corporations.State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, had the statue created to push companies to increase the number of women directors.Artist Kristen Visbal's ""Fearless Girl"" drew crowds Wednesday that initially came to pose for pictures with the bull, but the novelty quickly became a New York hot spot.The girl is sculpted in bronze, her hands firmly planted on her waist, ponytailed head held high.""Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference,"" reads a plaque at her feet.""As a steward of nearly $2.5 trillion of assets, we want to engage with boards and management around issues that we think will drive core results,"" said Lori Heinel, State Street's deputy global chief investment officer. ""And what you find repeatedly is having more diverse boards and more diverse senior management will actually drive better results for companies.""According to ISS Analytics, a business research firm, just 16 per cent of board seats on companies in the Russell 3000 are held by women; the average board of directors has eight men and one woman.""It's going to happen to the end of time unless you change something,"" says Erik Gordon, a lawyer and professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. ""It's got to not just be the rules. It's got to be the culture.""State Street has three women on an 11-member board. Heinel said her company also will urge those in Great Britain and Australia to add women to their leadership.One man working in corporate America needed no convincing.Chandrasekar Sundaram says a woman is the CEO of the company he works for in Texas, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and has quite a few women reporting to her.""But when it gets to 50 per cent, that's when I think it'll be right,"" said Sundaram, a Dallas resident and native of India who was visiting New York with his family - with the Charging Bull as one of their stops.The mammoth bronze was a ""guerrilla art"" act, dropped in the middle of the night in Bowling Green Park in 1989 without permission, by an artist who created it as a symbol of Americans' survival energy following the 1987 stock market crash. The city gave its permission for the bull to remain.This week, McCann New York, a top advertising agency, installed the statue of the girl before dawn Tuesday - with a city permit for one week. Negotiations are underway for the piece to remain longer."

","Actor Emraan Hashmi has been in the Hindi film industry for almost 14 years, but the one film which he considers a career-changer was Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai (2010).

I had worked with Kangana before this film, and Prachi and Randeep were amazing too. People had never imagined me in this kind of cinema, considering the serial-kisser tag I had?, says Emraan. He is appreciative of the fact that the makers had confidence in the subject. He says, ?The director Milan Luthria and the producers dared to take the risk, and had belief in the potential of the film. Facing the camera in the character was a huge change for me.?Ajay Devgn played the role of Sultan Mirza, while Emraan Hashmi was his nemesis ShoaibEmraan played the role of the rebellious Shoaib based on a real-life underworld don. His character locks horns with the smuggling overlord of Mumbai, Sultan Mirza, played by Ajay Devgn. Emraan reveals what appealed to him about the film. ?Before this, there had been landmark gangster films like Vaastav (1999), Company (2002) and Satya (1998), and I myself had rejected a lot of films based on the underworld?, he says. ?When Milan started narrating the script, I realised he had done something fresh and new with the concept. It was a ten minute narration, and the story focused on the vulnerabilities of the two characters Sultan and Shoaib. He didn?t even have a full script, but I was sold on the narration. And of course, there was the visual aspect- the cars of that era, the clothes, complete with the bellbottoms!? Emraan adds.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

However, ""Today, you go to a small village in India and they know SEBI,"" he stated. Sinha's six-year tenure as SEBI Chairman ended last week.","New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) Capital markets watchdog SEBI may be among Indias most powerful regulators today but there was a time when people used to introduce its former chief U K Sinha as Chairman of SBI -- a similar sounding acronym but of State Bank of India. Â  Â  ""At the start of my tenure at SEBI, people would introduce me as the chairperson of SBI, the State Bank of India (the country?s largest bank with a far flung branch network). Today, you go to a small village in India and they know SEBI,"" says Sinha, who retired as SEBI Chairman last week after a six-year tenure -- the second largest in nearly three decades of existence of the regulatory body.

Â  The study titled Securities Exchange Board of India: Developing and Regulating India?s Capital Markets has been done by Suraj along with research associate Radhika Kak.  According to the study, Sinha was reflecting on his past five years as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) when he made these remarks. Â  Â  ""It was February 2016 and he had just been appointed by the Government of India to a second term as the Chairman of SEBI,"" it noted. While SEBI as a regulator has made significant strides over the past decade, it was during Sinhas tenure that its powers increased manifold including for bringing to book entities guilty of insider trading and fraudulent investment activities such as illicit collective investment schemes. SEBIs tough actions against several large corporates even prompted some in recent years to call the regulator a dragon and of acting like an activist. "

Vani Vivek,05-2017,Sennheiser launches headphones priced at ?45 lakh in India,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/sennheiser-he-1-is-probably-worlds-best-headphone-and-it-costs-just-rs-45-lakh/1/945645.html ,"German audio company Sennheiser on Thursday launched its HE 1 headphones in India priced at ?45 lakh. The company claims the headphones took nearly a decade to develop and the production is limited to one unit a day. The headphones have gold-vapourised ceramic electrodes, while an accompanying amplifier is made using marble from Italy.","Successor to the legendary Orpheus, audio giant Senheiser's new HE 1 headphones are now available in India. And just like the legendary Orpheus, the new HE 1 will cost you a bomb to own. Senheiser has launched the premium, high-end headphones in India at an alarmingly high price tag of Rs 45,00,000. But, if the HE 1 are anywhere near as close as the headphones they will replace, well, they ought to be expensive. Â ""For a decade now in the Indian market, Sennheiser has shaped the industry and has been at the cutting edge of audio by continuously re-defining the gold standard of what is technically possible,"" said Sennheiser CEO Daniel Sennheiser. ""With the HE 1, we are once again pushing the boundaries and are showing that we can repeatedly set new benchmarks in excellence and reshape the future of the high-end audio world.""The new HE1 use a completely new amplifier concept that combines the superior impulse processing of a tube amplifier with the low distortion of a transistor amplifier ""to perfection"" according to the company. There are a total of eight vacuum tubes that process the incoming signal. The advantage of tube amplifiers is their superior impulse processing. However, one challenge is their sensitivity to air-borne-noise. For this reason, the amplifier housing is crafted from granular, in homogeneous Carrara marble and is freely suspended with the amplifier. The decoupling of the tubes in combination with the damping properties of the marble has the effect of reducing structure-borne noise to an absolute minimum. The tube amplifier stage is followed by a patented ultra-high impulse amplifier stage that is directly integrated into the cups of the headphones.Senheiser has used gold-vaporised ceramic electrodes in the headphones. The advantage of this design, it says, is the extremely short distance between the amplifier and the diaphragm which is less than one centimetre in the new HE1. Thus, the headphone system requires far less power for charge reversal. At a voltage of only around 5 Volt, the music signal is transmitted balanced to the high-voltage amplifier integrated into the headphones and is amplified there. This ensures extremely high impulse fidelity with relatively low power requirements. Just like the tubes of the tube amplifier, the system's MOS-FET transistors have a square characteristic curve to prevent the hard distortion that occurs in amplifiers with bi-polar transistors.Sennheiser uses a new amplifier concept in a class that the audio specialist calls Cool Class A. In the low-frequency range, Cool Class A provides Class A power at any volume. In the high- and ultrahigh-frequency range, the amplifier switches from Class A to the usual Class AB operation. That will, however, only be the case when listening to a very unusual frequency spectrum."

The decision has been taken to speed up the investigation in such cases, most of them pending for quiet a long time. The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has amended Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965, and decided time-line for critical stages of investigation and enquiry proceedings. The Inquiring Authority should conclude the inquiry and submit its report within a period of six months, says the amended rules. However, an extension for a period not exceeding six months at a time may be allowed for any good and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing by the disciplinary authority, it said.

The disciplinary authority shall deliver to a government servant, accused of irregularity and corruption, a copy of the articles of charge, the statement of the imputations of misconduct or misbehaviour and a list of documents and witnesses by which each article or charges is proposed to be sustained, the new rules said. On receipt of such articles of charge, the government servant shall be required to submit his written statement of defence, if he so desires, and also state whether he desires to be heard in person, within a period of 15 days, it said. The time-limit can, however, be extended for a period not exceeding fifteen days. But under no circumstances, the extension of time for filing written statement of defence shall exceed forty-five days from the date of receipt of articles of charge, the rules said. At present, there is no time-limit for submission of the employees statement of defence. The new rules are applicable to all category of employees excluding those in all-India services--Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS)-- and a few other categories of officers. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), in a directive, had last year expressed serious concern over delay in finalising corruption cases and asked all departments to complete these inquiries within a maximum period of six months to keep away ""nothing will change"" notion associated with governance.

As regulators try to establish a reliable nationwide credit rating system, authorities across the country are also exploring new ways to crack down on those who do not pay debts.         According to state media, one court in Jiangsu province has drawn up a blacklist of defaulters. Anyone who telephones an individual on the blacklist will first be forced to listen to a pre-recorded message saying ?please urge this person to fulfil their legal obligations?.Xinhua said the city of Wuhan has also launched a series of crackdowns on debt defaulters, and detained a total of 186 people in the first half of the year."

The previous format of four rounds of two minutes each had been recently scrapped by the International Boxing Association.""Hats off to the girls. They were marvellous in the way they handled the situation. Not one girl complained, they managed things in their own little ways but did not let the situation affect their performance.

She also said that the male perspective which dominates popular culture, has led to discrimination against women and ""makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment...abuse of women okay"".","A Bollywood director whose ?lady oriented? film was blocked by censors has hit back at the movie establishment, saying it needs more women at the top to battle deep-rooted Indian prejudice. ?The censors have a problem with a female point of view; they?re just not comfortable with something that questions or disturbs the status quo,? said Alankrita Shrivastava, whose film has now overcome its critics and will be released in Indian cinemas on Friday.Shrivastava said popular culture was shaped by man?s perspective, and it was therefore important to encourage more women directors, artists and storytellers. Her movie - which profiles women who break free from tradition - stars a Muslim woman and a middle-aged widow among its unlikely heroines.Shrivastava battled hard on social media for its release after India?s censor board refused to certify Lipstick Under My Burkha, calling the film ?lady oriented?.Shrivastava appealed the decision with the film certification tribunal, which said the film could be released with an adult certification and after minor cuts. Relating the story of four women who want to realise their dreams, the movie has sparked a debate in India over what is permissible in movies and how women are actually portrayed. ?Our popular culture, our cinema is largely a product of the male gaze, for the male gaze,? she said.?Art and popular culture are powerful tools we can use to have a conversation about perspective and conditioning. It can force us to think differently, see a different point of view.?Women film directors in India?s Bollywood, just as in Hollywood, make up only a small fraction of the industry. Churning out about 1,000 films a year, Bollywood is largely known for its formulaic fare of action flicks and syrupy romances with elaborate song-and-dance sequences.Movies with female protagonists and stories that challenge gender stereotypes are still rare. This has a far-reaching effect on audiences, said Shrivastava. ?Women are 50 percent of the population; we have a particular way of seeing things, but it is the male perspective that has dominated for so long in popular culture,? she said.?This perspective has led to discrimination against women, violence against women. Our popular culture justifies this perspective, and makes stalking seem like love, makes harassment and abuse of women okay.?Campaigners in India have urged the film industry to stop glorifying stalking and harassment after several violent deaths of women. There has also been a campaign to rewrite Bollywood songs to end gender stereotyping and misogyny in films."

""It would be wrong to say that this (US) administration has been ignoring India,"" officials added. Notably, this will be the first Trump-Modi meeting.","official (EDS: Incorporating Modi visit series) By Lalit K Jha Washington, Jun 24 (PTI) On the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modis US visit, the Trump administration has dismissed reports that it has been ignoring India, saying President Trump realises that the country has been a ""force for good"" in the world and ties with it were important. ""I think that it would be wrong to say that this administration has been ignoring or not focused on India,"" a senior administration official told reporters ahead of the two-day Modi visit from June 25. The Prime Minister would meet President Donald Trump face-to-face for the first time at the White House on Monday. ""I think that the US really appreciates India, and I think that President Trump realises that India has been a force for good in the world and that its a relationship thats important. And I think that will come through in the visit on Monday,"" the official said. The senior administration official made the remarks while responding to questions on whether the US-India relationship has drifted under the new government, in part, because of President Trump and the administrations support to China. ""I think its a bit unfair. I mean, were only six months into the administration. But there have been two very good phone calls between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi that you can point to as showing both countries interest in the relationship,"" the White House official argued. ""Yes, this will be the first opportunity for them to sit down and have a conversation, but I think that this is still fairly early on in the administration,"" the official said. Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said President Trump and Prime Minister Modi would have a very robust discussion when they meet at the White House. ""During the meeting, the President and the Prime Minister will discuss ongoing cooperation, including counter-terrorism, defence partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, global cooperation, burden-sharing, trade, law enforcement, and energy,"" Spicer said in response to a question. Senator Mark Warner, Co-Chair of the Senate India Caucus hoped that Trump, in his meeting with Prime Minister Modi, shows enthusiastic support for deepening the US-India relationship, which enjoys strong bipartisan support. ""The relationship is ripe for additional cooperation in areas such as the development of aircraft carrier technology, space surveillance, unmanned aerial vehicles, cyber and increased defense manufacturing,"" Warner said. ""As we venture further into the Asian Century, there is little doubt of the increasing significance of India on the world stage. Our cooperation helps increase global security and advance economic opportunity in both countries,"" Warner said in response to a question. On whether the contentious H-1B visa issue would come up for discussion during the meeting, a senior administration official said it was unlikely to be raised from the US side but if raised by the Indian side, the Americans were ready for it. Ahead of the visit, Indian Ambassador to the US Navtej Sarna said the first face-to-face meeting between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump will give them an opportunity to look at the entire gamut of Indo-US engagement and to exchange views on issues of global interest. At the invitation of Trump, the Prime Minister would spend several hours with the US President at the White House on Monday afternoon, which would end with a dinner later that night. This would be the first working dinner being hosted by Trump for a foreign leader at the White House. ""I think that just shows the amount of care that has gone in on the part of the White House to welcome our Prime Minister and the kind of planning that has gone into make this a very special visit,"" Sarna said. ""This (dinner) is a special gesture and it is appreciated,"" he said. On the agenda of the meeting, a senior administration official told reporters that the civil nuclear deal would be part of the discussions between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump. The White House also emphasised that the US was looking forward to its nuclear reactors contributing to Indias energy security. It said the US is interested in providing India with the kind of defence technology it normally reserves for its closest allies, signalling the Trump administrations resolve to strengthen the bilateral defence relationship. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar here and told him that Prime Minister Modis Washington visit would strengthen the Indo-US relationship and help advance the common interest in fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth. The two agreed that the two countries have a deep and growing strategic partnership and hope to work more closely on regional and global issues. Jaishankar also met other senior officials at the State Department. Ahead of his visit, Modi yesterday said he looked forward to the opportunity of having an in-depth exchange of views. ""My USA visit is aimed at deepening ties between our nations. Strong India-USA ties benefit our nations & the world,"" he tweeted. "

Travellers and airport staff expressed relief at no longer having to travel to Labraq airport, a four-hour drive east of Benghazi, which had replaced Benina as the main airport for the eastern part of the country.

Abhishek Bansal,01-2017,"Shane Warne was guilty of accepting bookie's money, drug use",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/acb-breaks-silence-admits-shane-warne-and-mark-waugh-accepted-money-from-bookie/1/265554.html ,"Former Australian cricketer Shane Warne, along with teammate Mark Waugh, was found guilty of accepting money from a bookmaker in 1994 in exchange of leaking information. The leg-spinner was also banned from international cricket for a year for failing a drug test before the 2003 World Cup. Warne later claimed the drug was given by his mother for weight loss.","It was the day all hell broke loose in Australian cricket, the day Australian players were found with their hands in the till. The Australian Cricket Board (ACB), which had kept the information secret for years, finally admitted that two of their cricketing icons Mark Waugh and Shane Warne had been paid to provide information to an Indian bookmaker during the Singer Cup in Sri Lanka in 1994. It was an enormous shock to the cricket community and beyond. The assumptions on which Australian cricket has been built were shattered.Inevitably the backlash has been severe. Australian Prime Minister John Howard expressed fury at ACB's coverup. Questions were asked in Parliament. Radio stations featured nothing else as callers vented their anger. Newspapers told the tale beneath soaring headlines on their front and back pages. Not in Australia's recent past has such emotion been aroused by a sporting event. The prosecution had turned into the defendant. People felt let down.The response in the subcontinent was quite the opposite. In Pakistan Salim Malik called it ""the happiest day of my life"". Warne and Waugh had claimed in 1995 that Malik had offered them $200,000 (Rs 85 lakh) to play poorly. Says Malik: ""Their allegations destroyed my career at a time when I was at my peak. Now I want to see what the International Cricket Council (ICC) and their board will do."" Indeed the Warne-Waugh issue raises several questions: why did the ACB cover it up and why did the ICC, which knew of the incident in 1995, choose to keep quiet?In India interest centred on the identity of the bookie. The Australians believed he was from Chennai and apparently named ""John"". Among Indians rumours pointed to a powerful Delhi-based bookie called Mukesh. What mattered more was: do Indian players also report on the weather? Technically, it is not match-fixing, yet giving out information on pitches (will it turn on the fourth day?) and match conditions is unethical. The Melbourne Age even quoted former Australian batsman Dean Jones as saying, ""There are 'moles' in every cricket team around the world ready to sell information to bookmakers."" Last year former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif had said several Indian players used to call him seeking such information.It is a startling coincidence that the Warne-Waugh episode has its roots in the 1994 Singer Cup. Manoj Prabhakar alleged that it was at this cup that a teammate offered him money to throw a match against Pakistan. Pakistani bookie Salim Pervez told Pakistan's Judicial Commission investigating match-fixing that he had handed Malik a briefcase with $100,000 (Rs 42.5 lakh) allegedly to fix the tournament's Pakistan-Australia match. And it was while the Singer matches were on that Waugh and Warne were approached.One unsubstantiated story has it that a man approached Warne, told him he was a great cricketer, gave him $5,000 (Rs 2.12 lakh) to spend at the gambling tables and later returned to genially ferret information. Whatever, this request for innocuous information on pitch and weather conditions is seen as a sweetener, the first step of a devious seduction. Warne and Waugh, both inveterate gamblers, took the bait for $5,000 and $6,000 (Rs 2.55 lakh) - less than their fines of $8,000 (Rs 3.4 lakh) and $10,000 (Rs 4.25 lakh) - unaware that they were being softened up for a later sting. Explains Ray: ""He denied it at first. And I said if you say that to me (deny it) on record then the matter is closed as far as I'm concerned. But Mark said 'I don't want to say anything' and that made me suspicious."" Still, Ray could not pin down the evidence.A month ago Malcolm Conn, another Australian journalist, picked up some rumours while covering the judicial inquiry in Lahore. Pursuing the story, he too met with a lot of brick walls and fabrications. Gradually other reporters started sniffing around and the ACB realised that suppression was no longer an option.Slowly the facts emerged over what happened. Alarmed by the original allegations about Malik's attempts to bribe their players and rattled by a phone call from Ray asking questions, senior ACB officials in 1995 instructed the Australian team manager Ian McDonald to find out whether any other payments had been offered or accepted. McDonald was with the team in New Zealand where he asked each player. It was then that Warne and Waugh admitted taking money from the bookmaker for giving out apparently routine information.Upon hearing these indiscretions, Graham Hablish, then ACB chief executive, and Alan Crompton, then ACB chairman, met the players in a hotel room near Sydney airport - the team was on its way to the Caribbean - imposed the fines of $10,000 and $8000 and promptly let the matter rest. Only after the team's departure was the rest of the ACB told of the fines. More pertinently, wrote Ray, ""The (board) meeting's minutes did not record any discussion of this serious matter.""As it happened the ICC's Sir Clyde Walcott and David Richards were in Sydney at the time and they were told about these breaches and sworn to secrecy. Incredibly the ICC allowed the cover-up to continue. As Richards argued in a press release last week, ""Historically each country has had the sole power and responsibility to deal with its own players on matters of discipline.""Mean while, the Pakistani board was attempting to come to grips with the scandals in its own backyard. Notwithstanding the diligent work of the judge leading the inquiry in Lahore and the courage of several Pakistani players in telling their side of the story neither the ACB nor the ICC thought it necessary to tell the inquiry commission that some of the Australian witnesses had been compromised.

A police team immediately arrived at the spot. ?The woman provided us the photos she had taken and described the man?s features in detail,? said an investigator.The inputs from the woman proved vital. Using the registration number, the police first tracked down the car?s original owner. The owner told police he had sold the car to a man who lived in the Hodal village in Haryana?s Palwal district.A police team reached Hodal to track down the car?s new owner. He led them to the suspect ? Tarun Kumar, his driver. Tarun told police he had dropped off the car owner?s relative at a mall in south Delhi before heading to a park in Greater Kailash to while away his time.Initially, he pleaded innocence claiming that he was urinating on the roadside, but allegedly broke down and confessed to the crime when confronted with the woman?s version.He has been booked for crimes such as performing an obscene act and using a gesture intended to outrage the modesty of a woman. No previous criminal cases against him has been found, said police.The DCP, meanwhile, used this case to call out to other women to ?stand for themselves?. ?One may see her (the German woman) as a victim in this case, but we see her as a hero of this story,? said Baaniya."

His interrogation also led to the recovery of the severed head of one of the two women, whose body was found earlier. A love triangle, a possible sex racket, and Thapa's greed for money were the reasons behind the murders, police said.","The alleged prime accused in Munirka double murder case, Arjun Thapa, was arrested from Agra on Tuesday. His interrogation led to the recovery of the severed head of Sonam, one of the two women whose decapitated body was pulled out from a sewer on the ground floor of a Munirka building on November 25. Sonam?s head was recovered from another sewer located barely 10 meters away from the building. The head, with scanty skin cover remaining, was stuck inside the vent pipe, police said. Ironically, the police had searched that sewer twice for the missing head after the recovery of Sonam?s body. But the head could not be recovered, as it was stuck inside the plumbing vent. The police had checked only waste-in and waste-out pipes. Read |Delhi cops hunt for 4 suspects in brutal murders of sex workersSenior police officers said they initially did not believe Thapa?s claims that he had dumped Sonam?s head in the sewer through its manhole. It was only when Thapa maintained his claim despite sustained interrogation that the police searched the sewer again and found a third duct where the head was stuck. Thapa?s live-in partner, Mini Sangam aka Neha from Meghalaya, and their cook Jeevan from Nepal, were arrested on December 10 for allegedly killing two freelance spa therapists, Sushma alias Sonam from Assam and Nayesha from Nepal on November 16 and 17. The fourth accused, Govind, continues to be at large. Police were hunting for the duo in areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh bordering Nepal, after they learnt that their last location was in Nepal. RP Upadhyay, joint commissioner of police (southeastern range), said that Thapa?s arrest was crucial in the case as he was the main conspirator and only he could tell the exact motive behind the two gruesome murders. A love triangle between Arjun, Neha and Sonam, Arjun?s greed for money, and a possible sex racket merged to make a compelling motive in the murder of Sonam and Nayesha. Arjun owed Rs 3 lakh each to Sonam and Nayesha but was not returning it to them, said police.Read |Love triangle, sex ring, money behind chopped bodies found in Delhi?s MunirkaManishi Chandra, additional DCP (south), said that interrogation of Neha and Jeevan revealed that Arjun had hideouts, not only in Delhi but also in other states, where he had associates and facilitators.

The issue was supposed to hit the stands a couple of weeks after the film's release.When the magazine's team sent Shahid a scan of the feature story, before the issue was sent to the press for printing, Shahid apparently 'balked', according to the magazine's editor. Shahid, reportedly, did not like being called a 'star' in the story's headline and demanded that 'star' should be changed to 'superstar'.

The magazine's editor reportedly 'felt silly for indulging the actor's whims' and immediately ensured that the issue was called back in time so that the headline could be changed again.

""In that process, we might be losing out on interesting stories that should be told, and I hope the environment changes,"" Siddharth further said.","Coming on the heels of the controversy about Indu Sarkar, a top official of the Film and Television Producers Guild of India says such topics have become ?radioactive? nowadays. Speaking at the Word To Screen, Publishers Bootcamp by Jio MAMI here, Guild president Siddharth Roy Kapur said that ?making a biopic on a political figure is radioactive right now?.Later, prodded by IANS to elaborate on the sidelines of the event, Kapur said, ?It?s unfortunately the environment that we are in at this point of time that most filmmakers are self-censoring when it comes to subjects that they pick to make a movie about because they are concerned about how it will finally be received when it goes to the CBFC for clearance. In that process, we might be really losing out on quite a few interesting stories that should be told, and I do hope that the environment changes.?Movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha and Udta Punjab ran foul of the censor board but were cleared after appeals or cuts.Kapur, former head honcho of Studios, Disney UTV, said that former actress Smriti Irani?s appointment as Cabinet Minister for Information and Broadcasting, would bring about a change for the Indian film industry which was constantly battling censorship woes. ?It?s a very positive step because she?s someone who understands the industry. I?m quite certain that we will see an easy and a more liberal view of film certification in the months to come,? Kapur said.?I believe that the (government-appointed) Shyam Benegal Committee has made some very good recommendations on what should be done as far as the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) is concerned. I do hope that?s implemented at the earliest,? added Kapur.Given that the $2 billion film industry of India, one of the largest movie-producing nations in the world, was not generating the moolah it should for a multiple of reasons -- lack of screens, slowdown in domestic theatrical revenue, steady growth in Hollywood market share and emergence of digital platforms and quality content -- Kapur sees light at the end of the tunnel.?Every industry goes through cyclical times. The cycle we are going through right now is where the economics are very challenging. Having said that, I?m quite optimistic that since we have a very strong movie-going culture, our own ethos of a star system and our own grammar of storytelling, we will come out of this,? said Kapur.?I think it?s about the industry figuring out an economic model that makes sense to everyone in the value chain rather than for a few people. And once that changes, we will see the industry do much better,? he said, adding how filmmakers need to be ?smart about their films?, release date and strategy.As for Hollywood eating into local films? business, he said, ?It?s happening and it?s definitely something to be concerned about... Because the fact is that they are making movies that are bringing people to cinemas... And that?s what we need to do too.?Exorbitant fee charged by stars can sometimes inflate a film?s budget, but breaking away from the strongly-rooted star system is going to be no answer either, said Kapur. ?I don?t think the star system will break and I don?t think it should. But I think that along with the star system, there needs to be great content that can stand on its own without any star. I have seen so many movies in the recent past that have done this and have done it very effectively,? he said.Kapur has been associated -- as producer, co-producer or associate producer -- with a mix of these -- Dangal, Kai Po Che, The Lunchbox, Raajneeti, Barfi!, Chennai Express, Shahid, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana, A Wednesday and Paan Singh Tomar. Now he is on a new journey of his own -- that of driving his home banner Roy Kapur Films.?I?m very excited about this next phase of my career where I will be looking at all kinds of content across the board, genre-agnostic, completely. I just want to tell great stories; do some great movies that I can be proud of,? he said.His slate includes an Aamir Khan-starrer biopic on astronaut Rakesh Sharma and a biopic based on the life of a man named Vijendra Singh who had lost his wife Leela in the Uttarakhand floods.Not ready to spill more beans about any of his projects, Kapur said: ?It?s a little early to talk about any of them at this point of time.?"

Westworld actors Sir Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood were nominated for Outstanding lead actor and actress in a drama. Indian-American actor Aziz Ansari has been nominated in the Outstanding lead actor in a comedy category for Master of None.,"HBO kept its place at the top of the Emmy nominations tree with its robot western series Westworld bagging 22 nominations at this year?s event, which saw it tie with the comedy show Saturday Night Live for the most nods.The haul amounted to one fewer nomination than HBO?s usual Emmy juggernaut Game of Thrones managed last year, and was a shock to some observers who predicted a more modest showing from a series that had a mixed reception upon its release.The show will battle it out for the top honour, outstanding drama series, alongside Better Call Saul, House of Cards, Stranger Things, The Crown, The Handmaid?s Tale and This Is Us. Homeland and The Americans missed out.Westworld also had a good showing in the acting categories, with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Evan Rachel Wood nominated for best lead actors and Thandie Newton and Jeffrey Wright recognised in the supporting actor categories.Saturday Night Live also received 22 nominations, including a nod for Alec Baldwin and his impression of Donald Trump, while Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Vanessa Bayer, were all recognised in the best supporting actress in a comedy series category.On Thursday morning in Los Angeles, the Veep actor Anna Chlumsky and the Criminal Minds star Shemar Moore read out the nominations. It was another diverse list following last year?s showing, in which actors of colour were nominated in all the leading actor categories ? a first. That feat wasn?t repeated this year, with no actors of colour nominated in the best actress in a limited series or a television musical.Donald Glover?s Atlanta received nods for best comedy series and best comedy actor for Glover. ABC?s Black-ish is up for best comedy series, and its lead actors, Anthony Anderson and Tracee Ellis Ross, were both nominated in the best comedy actor and actress categories. Aziz Ansari?s Master of None is also up for best comedy, and Ansari for best comedy actor, while HBO?s The Night Of took 13 nominations.Viola Davis was nominated again for best actress in a drama series for her role in How To Get Away With Murder, and Sterling K Brown was nominated for best actor in a drama series for his performance in This Is Us.The only real shocks came in the best talk show category, where Jimmy Fallon missed out and Bill Maher?s Real Talk was nominated despite controversy surrounding the host, who used the N-word on the show recently. Samantha Bee?s Full Frontal was also included, while Jerry Seinfeld?s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee missed out.Other shows that missed out were the Leftovers, which didn?t bag any nominations in the main categories, plus Girls and Transparent which both missed out in the best comedy series category. Mr Robot?s Rami Malek also missed out on best actor in a drama series despite winning in that category last year. Carrie Fisher was given a posthumous nomination for her role in Catastrophe."

Parichit Mainra,01-2017,Ex-Prez Bush's daughters write letter to Obama sisters,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bush-twins-write-heartfelt-letter-to-obama-sisters/1/856484.html ,"Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager, twin daughters of former US President George Bush have written an open letter to the outgoing 'First Children' Malia and Sasha Obama. The letter advises them to enjoy life as they would not be under public scrutiny and criticism anymore. It also asked them to never forget people who worked at the White House.","From Seema Hakhu Kachru Houston, Jan 13 (PTI) In a heartwarming open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama, former first daughters Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager shared a bit of advice to the girls as they join ""another rarified club, one of former First Children"". ""We have watched you grow from girls to impressive young women with grace and ease,"" the Bush sisters wrote in aÂ letter to the Obama girls. ""Now you are about to join another rarified club, one of former First Children ? a position you didnt seek and one with no guidelines. But you have so much to look forward to,"" it said. ""You will be writing the story of your lives, beyond the shadow of your famous parents, yet you will always carry with you the experiences of the past eight years,"" the Bushes wrote in their letter published yesterday in Time magazine. The Bush daughters, who first became familiar with the White House during the presidency of their grandfather, George H W Bush, recalled returning to the executive mansion in 2008 as young women to show the Obama girls around. They gave them a tour of bedrooms that once belonged to them and showed them how to slide down the banister of the solarium. ""In eight years, you have done so much. Seen so much,"" the Bush sisters write, noting Malia and Sashas meeting with Nelson Mandela in the cell where he was imprisoned for decades, as well as trips with their mother to Liberia and Morocco to speak with girls about the importance of education. The Bush sisters stress to 15-year-old Sasha, and 18-year-old Malia, that there is much to look forward to, but urge them to keep close in their hearts the experiences of the past two terms. One bit of advice was to stay in touch with those White House staff who made them feel at home and those who helped protect them. As Malia prepares to attend college this fall at Harvard, while Sasha remains in Washington to finish high school, they encourage the sisters to enjoy this youthful period of their lives. ""And you wont have the weight of the world on your young shoulders anymore. Explore your passions. Learn who you are. Make mistakes ? you are allowed to."" ""Enjoy college. As most of the world knows, we did,"" they say, a nod to the much-reported brushes with the law both Bush twins experienced while drinking underage. "

Indoctrinated by extremist ideology, the girl reportedly tried to get a gun and grenade. The teenager is accused of received instructions on how to use the weapons allegedly between December 2016 and April 2017.","A teenage girl is alleged to have married an Islamic State fighter in Syria via Skype and became so indoctrinated that she tried to get a gun and grenade to stage a terrorist attack against Britain. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday charged with the alleged plot.She is believed to be from a Moroccan background and was aged 16 when she met the alleged Isis terrorist, who originally comes from Coventry, online. He is now believed to be dead, killed in a drone strike in April.The teenager, from London, is accused of receiving instructions on how to use the weapons and asking for help in carrying out the plot. The case is said to have involved explicit foreign direction, and the plotting is alleged to have happened between 1 December 2016 and 12 April 2017.The accused was aged just 16 when she ?married? the Isis fighter via Skype, in an online ceremony. There is considerable doubt that it would be considered valid under either Islamic or British laws. The man is understood to have used the internet and social media including Skype, an online voice and video communications programme.During Wednesday?s short court hearing, her lawyer, Vajahat Sharif, said that the girl would plead not guilty. In court, the teenager, wearing a Nike tracksuit and with her long black hair tied in a ponytail, spoke only to confirm her name and age.District judge Tan Ikram remanded her in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on 11 August. She will also appear there on the same date in relation to another terror offence for which she had previously been charged.In a statement the Metropolitan police said the teenager had been charged with having ?the intention of committing acts of terrorism engaged in conduct in preparation for giving effect the that intention?.The elements of the offence, the Met said, were: ?i. Communicating with a Daesh [Isis] fighter in Syria and arranging to receive weapons in order to conduct an attack in the UK; ii. Receiving instructions on how train and use weapons; iii. Reaching out to another to receive assistance in completing plan.?Last week, Met commissioner Cressida Dick said: ?Six attack planning plots were thwarted in the last four months alone, and we can expect that figure to rise.?Britain?s top police officer added: ?The bulk of this domestic threat seems to be from those who are inspired by overseas networks, though there have undoubtedly been some who have been more directly enabled by them also, and we should not assume that attempts by senior leaderships of overseas groups to direct more or less sophisticated UK attacks have gone away.?The terrorist threat level from Islamist inspired terrorism in Britain remains at severe, meaning that an attack is considered highly likely. Three such attacks have claimed lives in Britain since 22 March."

Sumedha Sehra,08-2017,WiFi at Indian railway stations better than London's: Google,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/technology/story/our-wi-fi-at-indian-railway-stations-is-better-than-san-francisco-london-wi-fi-google/1/1015791.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Google's head of connectivity in India recently talked about the Google RailTel, which has started providing free WiFi at 140 railway stations in India. ""If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacity"", he said. The initiative aims to cover 400 stations across the country.","As a part of Prime Minister Modi's Digital India initiative, the Indian Railways have partnered with Google to provide Wi-Fi broadband facility to passengers at major railway stations across the country. This Google RailTel initiative was launched in January 2016 and till date has reached 140 stations across India. Their lofty aim is to reach 400 stations by 2018.Under this initiative, RailTel, a subsidiary of the government of India provides the high speed network via Fiber while Google sets up the wireless infrastructure and provides tech support. The speeds on offer range from 20-40Mbps for 30 minutes after which they are gradually reduced in order to manage bandwidth.The India Today Tech had the opportunity to experience Google's RailTel initiative first hand at Nizamuddin Railway station. We also interviewed Gulzar AzadÂ  -- head of connectivity, Google India -- who spoke about the partnership with RailTel, the challenges faced in bringing high-speed Wi-Fi to 140 of India's major railway stations, what Google and RailTel have learnt along the way and the road ahead for this ambitious initiative.Q: This initiative started before Jio revolutionised the telecom sector with its disruptive plans and brought 4G to the masses. Have you seen a dip in the daily usage since Jio entered the marketplace? Has the widespread and cheap availability of 4G data since the entry of Jio affected Google's RailTel strategy in any way?This is a great question. Very relevant in today's time. What we have seen is that as 4G has emerged, we have seen no dip in the Wi-Fi usage. If you talk about the time when 'free' 4G started emerging, we were at about 5 million (50 lakh) monthly active users, today we are at 6.5 million (65 lakh) monthly active users. So the RailTel initiative has only grown since then.The railway station is a great point of convergence. At this point of convergence, there is the need for multiple networks and multiple systems to satisfy the user demand. Before the advent of 'free' 4G, people were not even thinking of consuming 1GB data a month, let alone 1GB data a day.The mark of telecommunication development of any country is how close the Fiber is to the user. In effect, you must see that the Wi-Fi that we are implementing is an attempt to bring Fiber close to the user. And that is working pretty well for us.Q: During my interactions with passengers and workers at the Nizzamudin railway station, I found out that many of them feel that during peak hours the speed slows down quite a bit. Is that something you are looking into?I feel that is also a very interesting, emerging phenomenon. If you see when we started the project, even at peak hours the speed we were giving the users was very satisfactory and now people want more. This is exactly what we were expecting. Once people start experiencing high-speed internet, the user behavior changes - the expectation now is higher. There is more demand for less and less latency in the network.The good news for us is that across the last twelve months, we have not seen a dip in monthly active users. The average usage still remains 350MB per user per session which shows we have augmented the network and capacity while adding more users.As 4G has emerged, we have seen no dip in the Wi-Fi usage. If you talk about the time when 'free' 4G started emerging, we were at about 5 million monthly active users, today we are at 6.5 million monthly active usersMr Gulzar Azad then spoke about how Google is taking steps to make the RailTel initiative financially viableSince April, we have made the login process Ad supported and that is helping RailTel from an ISP perspective. The revenue is majorly meant for RailTel. We have a revenue share mechanism which is expected as we are a contributor to the project itself - Google helps build the wireless (infrastructure) and RailTel brings in the Fibre and the connectivity.Q:The RailTel initiative was in the news a couple of months ago as it was found that it was being used for watching porn in many railway stations. Were any measures put into place after that?The idea of the internet here from an experience point of view is to make it the same internet that you and I have and for that internet to be available to everyone. That is the singular goal of our vision - for a billion people to experience the internet you and I experience in our homes, in our offices.Â  And when we do that, we are following the regulations set by the country.The ISP (RailTel) follows the regulations from the government in terms of what's allowed on the internet and what's not. This internet is not different from every other internet across the country.Q: If we talk about the speed, I was told that 1Mbps is the minimum speed even when the 30 limit high speed cap is crossed. Is that a realistic claim?The way the network has been set up there is actually no speed limit before or after. The design of the network is such that in the first 30 minute time limit, we allow the user to get unfettered access - the idea is to get all users to a point where they could access high quality HD video streams.After the time limit is crossed, we make sure that everybody does still have internet and the net is still low latency. We are adjusting the network dynamically so that people can still access the internet but in the first half an hour they can access HD quality video streams.Q: But what is the minimum speed? - I spoke to many people and got a lot of varying replies. Some people said it is as bad as 128kbps but others said they can stream video for 24 hours.The quality of your internet is not just measured by the speed. It is also measured by the latency of the network. We have designed the network in a way that even when the network is at low speed, it is still a low latency network. The internet is dynamically configured in such a way that you will still be able perform certain use cases (like opening a search page, running apps like WhatsApp and Messenger) after the high-speed cap gets over after 30 minutes.This is a great advancement. If you compare this with Wi-Fi in London and San Francisco, you will find that the Wi-Fi is better in both coverage and capacityNote: The network is dynamically adjusted in such a way that priority is given to those who are logging in for the first time. This is why the 30 minute high-speed cap exists. During our time at the Nizamuddin railway station we got average speeds of 17-18mpbs (download) during the 30 minute unfettered limit. Also, we found out that all access points are already dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz capable) in order to cope with future demand.Q: What is the business model that Google and RailTel are following? How is Google benefiting from this project?For Google, this is an ecosystem project. Our idea with this is to make sure there is more and more broadband adoption. The more the adoption, the more people come online, and the greater the economic impact.When there is economic impact on digitisation, we get directly impacted because we are a stakeholder in the digitisation of the country. Also, the more people use internet, the more they use e-commerce, social networks, news websites and eventually Google services.Q: At the Nizamuddin railway station and the New Delhi railway station, which I visited a few weeks ago, the advertising is quite minimal. Also a lot of people, even in tier 1 cities like Delhi and Mumbai are unaware of this initiative. So what is Google and RailTel's future plans regarding awareness?Addressing awareness of Wi-Fi is certainly an important issue and we need the help of the Indian railways and the government to do that more and more. As you can see, the Wi-Fi is already free, so there is not much space for businesses to market on it. But the Indian Railways who host this, they should be partnering with us to make more and more awareness happen.There are various channels of awareness. We have tried audio announcements and visuals. We have also tried having agents at the station. I think to raise awareness in a sustainable way we need help from the government."
Gaurav Shroff,07-2017,Marine life thrives on island 71 yrs after 23 nuclear tests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/15/quite-odd-coral-and-fish-thrive-on-bikini-atoll-70-years-after-nuclear-tests?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Stanford researchers have found an abundance of marine life at Bikini Atoll island, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the US tested 23 bombs between 1946-1958, including one 1,100 times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. The team discovered a diverse ecosystem thriving in the crater with corals and fish, and crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore.","The former island paradise of Bikini Atoll is slowing blooming back to life, 70 years after the United States dropped 23 nuclear bombs on it, including a device in 1954 that was 1,100-times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb. A team of scientists from Stanford University have been surprised to discover an abundance of marine life apparently thriving in the crater of Bikini Atoll, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the bombings, with its 167 inhabitants relocated to other islands.Steve Palumbi, a professor in marine sciences at the university, said the effects of radiation poisoning on ocean life have never been studied in-depth, and his team?s initial research suggests it is ?remarkably resilient?. Animals studied by scientists in and around the Chernobyl blast showed deformities and mutations, but the Stanford teams initial research suggest the marine life in Bikini may have fared significantly better. Palumbi?s team discovered a diverse eco-system of animal life in and around the bomb crater, including coral as big as ?cars?, hundreds of schools of fish including tuna, sharks and snapper, and coconut crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore. Palumbi said to the naked eye the crabs, fish and coral of Bikini Atoll look perfectly normal and healthy, and some of the coral has been around for decades ? with evidence it may have begun growing as soon as 10 years after the last bombs were dropped.?The lagoon is full of schools of fish all swirling around the living coral. In a strange way they are protected by the history of this place, the fish populations are better than in some other places because they have been left alone, the sharks are more abundant and the coral are big. It is a remarkable environment, quite odd.? Palumbi?s team concentrated their research efforts on the coral and coconut crabs ? which are the size of hub caps ? because they have long-life spans, allowing the scientists to delve into what effect the radiation exposure has had on the animals DNA after building up in their systems for many years. Because fish have relatively short life-spans it is possible the worst-affected fish died off many decades ago, said Palumbi, and the fish living in Bikini Atoll today are only subject to low-levels of radiation exposure as they frequently swim in and out of the atoll. ?This is the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean, dropping 23 atomic bombs on it, yet the ocean is really striving to come back to life,? said Palumbi. ?The fact there is life there and the life there is trying to come back from the most violent thing we?ve ever done to it is pretty hopeful.?Even though plant, animal and ocean life is showing strong signs of recovery, humans are still unable to live and work on the atoll, besides a few caretakers who bring food and water supplies with them, and keep up the islands facilities. A United Nations report in 2012 said the effects of radiation were long-lasting. Special rapporteur Calin Georgescu, in a report to the UN human rights council, said ?near-irreversible environmental contamination? had led to the loss of livelihoods and many people continued to experience ?indefinite displacement?.The water cannot be drunk because of continued contamination, the seafood cannot be eaten, and plants cannot be farmed because of contaminated soil. More than half of the 167 original inhabitants of Bikini Atoll have now died, and many went to their graves still longing to return to their homeland. According to a paper by Timothy J. Jorgensen, associate professor of radiation medicine at Georgetown University, former residents of Bikini Atoll started showing cancers related to radiation exposure in the 1960s. Those down-wind of the explosions had burns and depressed blood counts. Those on islands further afield showed elevated risk for cancers, particularly thyroid cancers and leukaemia, and have been involved in a protracted compensation claim with the United States for decades. ?What happened to the Marshall Islanders next is a sad story of their constant relocation from island to island, trying to avoid the radioactivity that lingered for decades,? writes Jorgensen. ?Over the years following the testing, the Marshall Islanders living on the fallout-contaminated islands ended up breathing, absorbing, drinking and eating considerable amounts of radioactivity.?"

The deceased, 51-year-old Theunis Botha, was with a group of hunters when an elephant picked him up. One of the hunters then shot the elephant, which collapsed on top of Botha and crushed him to death.","There is an idiom that elders often throw around: Pick on someone your own size. The keyword here is 'size'.A professional South African hunter in Zimbabwe, who specialised in 'big game' hunting, ended up being crushed to death under an elephant that had been shot.Theunis Botha, 51, was hunting at the Hwange National Park with his group, when he crossed paths with a herd of pregnant elephants. The elephants did not quite like this sudden meet-up with gun-carrying humans, and so, came charging at the hunters.In retaliation, Botha started firing at the charging animals. What he did not see, however, is that one elephant was coming towards him from the side. Before Botha knew it, he was up in the air by this elephant's trunk.Seeing this, one of the other hunters shot the elephant swinging Botha by its trunk, but they probably did not see how this could end. The wounded elephant released Botha, dropped him to the ground, and then collapsed right on top of him.Needless to say, Botha did not survive the crush. "

The Spanish club, which had provided technical support to the Indian club, will be selling their stake in the club to the club's principal owner Sanjiv Goenka. ","For Atletico de Kolkata (ATK) there is lots in a name. Or an acronym.So though Atletico Madrid won?t partner anymore, the Kolkata franchise of the Indian Super League (ISL) will continue to be known as ATK, said its principal owner Sanjiv Goenka.And would ATK continue to stand for what is was over the past three years? ?The name of the team is the name of the team and it is ATK. It can also stand for Aamar, Tomar Kolkata,? said Goenka. Translated from Bengali, that would mean the team for every Kolkatan.Speaking after the media conference where Goenka said this, a team official said it is premature to say that henceforth ATK would stand for something apart from what was coined three years ago after the La Liga giants came on board with a 25% stake in the ownership.?ATM (Atletico de Madrid) will sell their stake to me,? said Goenka. ?ATM and ATK have come to an agreement that they will not be part of ATK going forward. We?ve had a good relationship and we continue to be friends.?Goenka pointed out that the Madrid club hadn?t spent ?a penny? since joining in 2014. Atletico Madrid provided technical support including but not restricted to the coaching staff. They facilitated the pre-seasons in Madrid and were a major help in recruiting foreign players. The consistency of their imports played a major role in ATK winning two championships and being the semi-finalists in another.?We have competent technical team. Teddy (Sheringham) and Ashley (Westwood) bring a lot of experience, success and vision. And I hope we can fulfil expectation fans have from us. We have not let our fans down in the last three years,? said Goenka.?Babes compared to Bagan, EB?Goenka said even though the I-League and the ISL would be held simultaneously this season, there is no competition between ATK and Mohun Bagan and East Bengal in terms of garnering support. ?Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are great clubs with great legacies. We?ve grown up watching them, idolising them. We are not competing with anyone. They are ?dadas?, we are ?bachchas?,? he said."

A little after midnight, when they called for the bill, they noticed there were some ""inconsistencies"" in the amount charged. Jalan wrote that, at this point, the restaurant's manager was summoned, after which ""a heated, yet cordial argument"" ensued between the two parties.Ultimately, the manager accepted the restaurant's error, gave them a corrected bill, which Jalan said his friends paid and headed for the door ""as can be clearly viewed on the CCTV footage.""From here, as Jalan claims, things started going south: ""Seems like there was a misconception in the company staff, as the Manager tried to stop one of the friends by grabbing their arm, and when the individual tried to release himself from the strong grip of the Manager, around 8-10 highly aggressive, seemingly uneducated and brutish bouncers, decide to take matters into their own hands, and viciously jumped them NOT with the intent to restrict them, but rather to cause heavy and grievous harm.""Though Zomato now has taken down this review, it is still appearing on The Plunge Daily.Jalan further added that the restaurant staff ""broke several bottles on them,"" and that one of the bouncers slashed a deep cut in his friend's neck with a glass shard.

""On hearing this, the customers began misbehaving with our staff,"" said The Wine Company post. ""Our wine sommelier, who started reasoning with them, was then abused verbally, pushed across the restaurant and struck repeatedly without provocation.""The Wine Company claims that at this point, two bouncers intervened to take the three ""extremely drunk and unruly"" men out of the restaurant, with some assistance from the restaurant staff.""Once outside the premises of the restaurant, the three picked fights with passer-by's and were injured in the subsequent scuffle,"" said the post.The Wine Company also claimed that it was their restaurant manager who called the police.

It then takes us to a fictitious village in Delhi-Haryana border area, Mubipura, where people are gearing up for a wedding. Suddenly, cops reach the place looking for men to be sterilized. When the men try to hide, the cops hunt them down and drag them even as a 70-year-old and a 13-year-old male ask policemen to consider the futility of including them in the government-ordered drive. Indu Sarkar soon moves to the central character, Indu (Kriti) - an orphan who wants to become a poet but is told she must only dream to become a good wife and make a family. Following the advice, she marries Navin Sarkar (Tota Roy Chowdhury) who dreams of money, power and fame, while Indu?s dream is only to be a good wife. For almost half of the fiIm, Indu Sarkar remains the story of a docile, humble and meek orphan who surrenders to every whims and fancies of her husband even as she fights her own stammering and a lack of confidence.How this rather ?homely? woman stumbles upon victims of a police raid in a slum, decides to fight for them and eventually becomes one of the most powerful voices of dissent during the Emergency, form the rest of the narrative.Neil Nitin Mukesh in a still from the film.While the film was publicised as a film ?on Emergency?, it actually oscillates between a political drama and a typical Bollywood film about a couple. Unfortunately, the transition between the two narratives is neither smooth nor convincing.One of the saddest moments in the movie comes when Indu, after she has left her husband?s house for the sake of a couple of lost orphan kids, decides to sign the divorce papers Navin sends. When asked why she agreed for the divorce, she says, ?Saath reh kar acchi biwi nahi ban payi, ho sakta hai alag ho kar sukh de paun. (I could not be a good wife, maybe I can give him some comfort by staying away).? As if, all the protest and fight for freedom from a dictatorial government was nothing but a tool to pacify the husband.The background score of Indu Sarkar is too loud and misplaced. At times when a rather emotional moment is approaching, what you hear is the loud melodramatic sound usually used in Bollywood suspense dramas. Anupam Kher in a in a still from the film.Despite having gathered a group of critically appreciated actors, Madhur Bhandarkar fails to make the best use of them. Neil Nitin Mukesh is one of the most wasted talents in the movie. He has given some of his best performances as a mean, high-on-power person but his act as ?chief? in Indu Sarkar appears too superficial. Anupam Kher and Kriti Kulhari take the lead in acting department and stay true to their characters for most of the part. The supporting casts including Sheeba Chaddha, Ankur Vikal and Zakir Hussain, among others appear genuine in their roles.Neil Nitin Mukesh in a still from the film.However, the over-dramatic tone of the film kills their performances and leaves us with dialogues like ?Ek goli ne mere jawan, 6 foot ke bete ko 6 inch ki tasveer bana diya.?Trying to find logic in Indu Sarkar often becomes a task. For example, why does Indu keep roaming around in a rickshaw/auto in the Turkman Gate area every time she needs to witness an eye-opener about the Emergency when she is otherwise driven around in her husband?s car? Or, for that matter, why do the protesters (led by Anupam Kher as ?Nanaji?) keep naming each other when they meet inside a cinema hall to avoid getting caught by the cops? Isn?t the entire purpose of disguise defeated if they use the real names? What is the reason, do you ask? Well, Bollywood is the only word that comes to our mind.Kriti Kulhari in a still from the film.For those interested in the politics of films, there are two ways to look at Madhur Bhandarkar?s Indu Sarkar.One is to look it as a propaganda film against the Congress party, aims at showcasing the atrocities inflicted upon various communities during the Emergency. There is a subtle, yet, extremely clear attempt to highlight Muslims forming a major portion of the victims. We have Neil Nitin Mukesh channelling Sanjay Gandhi as the prime minister?s son who is only referred to as the ?chief? while the PM is referred to as ?mummyji?. The unofficial ban on Kishore Kumar from radio and television after he refused to sing for Sanjay Gandhi also gets a mention in the film. On the other hand, you can see Indu Sarkar as a double-edged sword. While it depicts the Emergency and the Gandhi family as the perpetrators of cruelty and injustice inflicted upon the masses, the film actually shows the misuse of power. If Madhur Bhandarkar wanted to patronise the ruling party, the irony of his own film is lost on him. The irony of Indu Sarkar is that it is so indulgent in highlighting the importance of free speech and democracy that you could change a few names, few other situations and it could well have been a film about the crisis India is facing today: People with allegiances to the ruling party exploiting the masses and even politicians at their own will.So, in the sheer hope that Madhur actually aimed for the latter political purpose, two stars for Indu Sarkar.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

","gains: VHP New Delhi, Feb 21 (PTI) The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) today said NDA constituent Shiv Sena was never a Hindutvavadi outfit and was pretending to be one only for political gains. Speaking to reporters here, VHP joint general secretary Surendra Jain said that merely chanting King Shivajis name does not make Shiv Sena a Hindutvavadi (one championing the Hindutva cause) party. ""I dont think Shiv Sena was ever a Hindutvavadi organisation. It is the media which gave this tag to Shiv Sena after Babri mosque was demolished,"" Jain said. ""It is pretending to be a Hindutuvavadi organisation for political gains,"" he added. His remark comes against the backdrop of stinging verbal exchanges between long-standing allies Shiv Sena and BJP leaders ahead of Maharashtra civic polls, voting for which was held today. Seeking to buttress his claim, the VHP leader stated late Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray himself was ""clueless"" about his party workers bringing portions of the mosque down in Uttar Pradeshs Ayodhya in 1992. ""He (Thackeray) himself had said he had no clue about it. But he said he was a proud man if his party men demolished the mosque. That one statement made them Hindutva champion...you dont become Hindutvavadi by merely chanting Chhatrapati Shivajis name,"" Jain claimed. Apparently referring to Shiv Senas sons-of-the-soil campaign in Maharashtra, particularly Mumbai, Jain said the party is rather a ""fissiparous"" force, which targeted its own Hindu brothers from south and north India for ""narrow benefits"" and does not understand broad concepts of Hindutva. ""When they talk about Hindutva...are Hindus from Tamil Nadu not Hindus? Whether Hindus from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh are not Hindus? Even today, they are beaten there (in Mumbai). "

The government plans to obtain a list maintained by Interpol of the domain names that host child sexual abuse content. The government can then ask the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to remove the access to such material.","The Narendra Modi government has roped in international police agency Interpol in a bid to crack down on sexual abuse and pornography of children amid a surge in photographs and videos on the internet showing kids being sexually exploited.EXPLOSION IN CHILD PORNOGRAPHYExperts say the advent of digital cameras and camcorders has fueled an explosion in such material available online. Last year, 96 reports of children being sexually exploited in internet imagery were reported in India - a rise of 140 per cent from 2014, according to National Crimes Records Bureau data. ""IT ministry has approved a formal agreement wherein Department of Telecommunications will obtain list maintained by INTERPOL containing domain names hosting child sexual abuse contents and act as an appropriate agency of the government to direct its licensee ISPs to expeditiously remove or disable access to material found in violation of the IT Act,"" the Centre said in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court. ""Further the mechanism to obtain the list containing domain names hosting contents of child sexual abuse is being worked out in consultation with the CBI."" The top court asked the Centre in February to suggest ways to ban child pornography in all forms in the country saying that the nation cannot ""afford to carry on any experiment"" in the name of ""liberty or freedom of speech and expression"". INTERPOL A MAJOR ASSET The SC was hearing PILs filed by Indore-based advocate Kamlesh Vaswani and Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association seeking a direction to the government to adopt various measures towards improvement in the effectiveness of blocking child pornography on the Internet and to eliminate it. RP Saxena, co-ordinator of the cyber Laws and e-security group of the government, said in the affidavit that a meeting was convened recently to seek cooperation and support from Internet Service Providers, which in turn can play an important role by blocking or disabling the lists containing domain names/URLs/website addresses hosting child pornography content. Interpol is a major source of getting access to such lists of websites containing child sexual abuse. The agency maintains a regular update of the ""worst"" of such sites. Interpol has been tasked by the UN General Assembly in 2009 to maintain and disseminate to the national central bureaus a worldwide list of URLs, which contains these websites that publish the most severe child abuse material. Ordering a crackdown against child porn, the SC had said that one needs to draw a distinct line between art and obscenity and child pornography cannot be justified in the name of freedom of speech and expression."

The bureau helps them find the right match, both within and outside the country. Samson started the arranged gay marriage service when he received numerous requests from gays regarding prospective life partners. Till 2013, he used to help gays with surrogacy. According to figures submitted by the government to the Supreme Court in 2012, there are 25 lakh gay people in India.

I am ashamed (of such remarks). I have taken birth on this soil. If it was some other state they would have been given a befitting reply. How dare they question my birth, my identity, my parents!

Peaty swam the 50m in 26.10 seconds, eclipsing the 26.42 seconds he produced at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. Notably, Peaty also won Britain a gold in the 100 metres breaststroke.","Adam Peaty surprised even himself after improving his own 50 metres breaststroke world record by almost half a second in one day at the world championships in Budapest on Tuesday.The Olympic champion won 100m breaststroke gold on Monday?s second day and vowed there would be ?something special? over one length on Tuesday. But even the 22-year-old did not expect what happened ? a 0.47sec improvement on the world record of 26.42sec he set in winning the 50m title in Kazan, Russia in 2015.Peaty clocked 26.10 in the morning heat, 0.44 ahead of his nearest rival, and improved his mark to 25.95 in the evening semi-final, 0.73sec clear of the field.?I didn?t think I was going to do that,? said Peaty, who shook his head in disbelief after seeing his time. Peaty, though, knows what matters is the title , when he will likely also be part of the British 4x100m mixed medley relay team seeking to win successive golds after victory in 2015. He added: ?I enjoyed it tonight. Obviously it?s nothing without the gold that goes along with it.?I?m going to be focusing now, staying neutral and see what we get tomorrow.? Peaty?s advantage is a huge margin over two lengths of the pool, let alone one. But he is focused on himself, having learned from experience since 2014 and winning Commonwealth, European, world and Olympic titles.?This morning I wasn?t prepared to do a world record,? Peaty added.?It was just me easing through the stroke and touching the wall. Progressing to the semi-final. It was the same tonight. I was on such a massive high from this morning and it was so hard to ignore the fact that I did a world record and try to get myself emotionally ready. I thought I was going to go slower [in the semi-final] because I was a little bit less energetic.?Peaty has the five fastest times in history over 50m breaststroke, a non-Olympic event, and admitted a sub-26sec swim had not been on his radar, with his focus on what he calls Project 56 ? swimming beneath 57sec over 100m, since Rio. He said: ?This morning everyone was like Project 25 and I was like ?go on then?. I just dived in tonight and was like ?I feel good?. I wasn?t that far behind after the start, which was a bonus for me.?Peaty surfaces sooner than his rivals, but so he is so powerful that he surges through the water.Cameron van der Burgh of South Africa, Peaty?s predecessor as world champion in 2013, clocked 26.54 in the morning heat, but finished his semi-final in 26.74 as Brazil?s Felipe Lima beat him in 26.68. Peaty is likely to be kept in reserve in the morning heats of the mixed medley relay, with Ross Murdoch an able deputy, and, assuming they qualify, Britain will be confident of success with Peaty coming in for an event which is now on the Olympic programme.Duncan Scott and James Guy earlier missed out on adding to Britain?s medal collection, which included Ben Proud?s 50m butterfly gold on Monday.. Scott and Guy had to settle for fourth and fifth place, respectively, in the 200m freestyle as the Olympic champion Sun Yang of China won his second gold, after 400m victory on Sunday. The Britons? semi-final times would have been good enough for the podium. ?It?s very disappointing. I think I got a little bit carried away at the start of the race,? Guy said.Scott, who begins his 100m freestyle campaign on Wednesday, said: ?I?m proud of that swim. I don?t think I did anything wrong, just others stepped up and performed when they needed to.?Kathleen Dawson was eighth in the 100m backstroke won by Canada?s Kylie Masse in a world record time of 58.10. And Sarah Vasey was eighth in the 100m breaststroke as the Olympic champion Lilly King of the United States won in 1:04.13."

We have picked up situations from his life over the past 24 years and put him on those situations again and shot in real time. We have archived around 10,000 hours of footage and from that we have made a film of two hours "" he said."

The topics we mostly discuss are marriage, divorce and inheritance,? said one sheikh staffing the booth for the morning commute, who declined to be named.According to al-Azhar al-Sharif, Egypt?s top Islamic body, which installed the booth, the project is intended to correct misinterpretations of Islam. The institution has frequently clashed with the government of the president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, who has repeatedly called for a ?religious reformation? in Islam to combat extremism.Egypt has grappled with a spike in jihadist activity since Sisi came to power in 2013, including a recent string of large-scale attacks on Coptic Christian sites as well as ongoing violence in the Sinai peninsula.Al-Azhar, established in Cairo in 971 as a centre of Sunni Muslim learning, is hoping that the booth will help steer Egyptians away from extremist thought.Sheikh Tamer Mattar, the coordinator of its International Centre for Electronic Fatwas, said that the booth was designed to direct citizens to seek advice from al-Azhar, instead of extremist groups. ?The experiment was successful so far and we hope that it will expand,? he said. ?We can say it was successful, as in the eight days of the initiative, we received 1,500 questions. At any moment you can find tens of people waiting to present theirs.?The booth operates two shifts daily, welcoming visitors from 9am until 8pm. Yet few seemed convinced that the project would attract those with pre-existing extremist tendencies to seek guidance, especially as those staffing the booth noted down the identity card number of those visiting along with their complaints. Extremists won?t come to us to seek advice,? said the sheikh staffing the booth for its morning shift. ?We?re targeting people on the street who are ignorant of religious matters ? they come to us and we try to put them on the right track of moderation.? Mohamed Abu-Hamed, an Egyptian MP who has sparred frequently with al-Azhar over a desire for greater government regulation of the religious body and its teachings, dismissed the booths. ?The whole project is absurd. It is a superficial understanding of the call to renew the religious rhetoric,? he said.?When we talk about renewing religious rhetoric, we mean the main content [of their teachings],? he said. ?If al-Azhar created these kiosks while thinking that this is renewing religious rhetoric, then they don?t get it. They are doing this to evade making any real changes.? "
Mansha Mahajan,03-2017,Switzerland warns it can suspend black money info exchange,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/can-suspend-auto-exchange-if-confidentiality-breached-swiss/1/913325.html ,"Following India's agreement on automatic exchange of information from next year about suspected black money hoarders in Swiss banks, Switzerland said it can suspend such exchange if confidentiality is not maintained. Further, the Swiss agency, mandated to defend the interests of Switzerland on international financial matters, said steps will be taken to ensure exchanged data doesn't get misused.","As India and other countries await an automatic exchange of information from next year about suspected black money hoarders in Swiss banks, Switzerland has said it can suspend such sharing of details at any time if confidentiality is not maintained. As part of an international commitment to fight the black money menace, Switzerland has effected the automatic exchange of information standard since January 1, 2017. The sharing of details under this framework will begin from next year with the first batch of countries, including India. ""Domestic financial institutions are collecting this data for the first time this year, and the Swiss tax authorities will exchange it with their counterparts in partner states in 2018,"" said the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters (SIF). The Swiss agency is mandated to defend the interests of Switzerland on international financial and tax matters and participates in international negotiations. It said in its latest quarterly newsletter that necessary steps will be in place to ensure the exchanged data do not fall into the wrong hands or get misused. ""Switzerland is prepared in principle to introduce the automatic exchange of information with all states and territories which meet the relevant requirements. In this sense, the confidentiality and security of the data are important elements of this international standard,"" it said. ""Switzerland implements the automatic reciprocal exchange of information only with countries which can guarantee confidentiality and data protection. Before any exchanges occur, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes carries out a thorough examination as to whether or not the partner states which have undertaken to introduce the automatic exchange of information comply with the requirements."" ""In some important cases, Switzerland additionally gets an on-the-spot impression of the situation in the partner states. Given that Switzerland does not belong to the group of countries which implemented the standard early on (so-called early adopters), it is also benefiting from the experience of other countries,"" the SIF said. ""Before the first exchange occurs, it will be able to examine if all significant elements of the standard have been met. Should it subsequently transpire that a country has not fulfilled its obligations, Switzerland can at any time suspend the automatic exchange of information with the country concerned,"" it added.SYSTEM IN PLACE 'RELATIVELY SIMPLE' The Swiss agency further said the system in place so far has been ""relatively simple"", wherein whenever a foreign tax authority was interested in obtaining information located in Switzerland, it had to make a request for administrative assistance. ""However, the rapid international developments in recent years have provided Switzerland with two new forms of exchange of information in the area of taxes: spontaneous and automatic exchange of information (AEOI),"" it added. In the case of the AEOI, countries mutually exchange information automatically on financial accounts and the details in this case are determined as the standards drawn up by the OECD. The information in spontaneous exchange needs to be exchanged if the transmitting country suspects that the information available might be of interest to another country. While spontaneous exchange has nothing to do with voluntary in this context -- it only means that no preliminary request has been submitted -- this framework was being handled very differently from country to country up to now, the SIF said. ""Within the scope of the OECD and G20 project to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), the spontaneous exchange of information was specified for the first time in the area of advance tax rulings, where there is a risk of base erosion or profit shifting."" ""The Federal Council adopted the current international standard in this area in the context of a revision of the Tax Administrative Assistance Ordinance. Switzerland will spontaneously exchange information on advance tax rulings for the first time next year,"" it added. 'NUMBER OF DOMESTIC SWISS BANK BRANCHES HAS HALVED' The agency further said that over the past 30 years, the number of domestic bank branches in Switzerland has almost halved. ""A reduction in the number of banking institutions and their branches can be the result of mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies. A number of policy measures have been put in place by Swiss authorities in recent years to address concerns of its banks providing high secrecy walls around their global clients. New rules make it much easier for several foreign jurisdictions, including India, to get details from Switzerland about people suspected to be involved in tax evasion and other financial crimes. Switzerland has also been issuing notices to several resident Indians and even Indians settled abroad after the receipt of request from India for ""administrative assistance"", including information about their Swiss bank account details. As per the local law, Switzerland gives an opportunity to the entity concerned to challenge the sharing of information, before providing the assistance to the requesting nation. While India and Switzerland late last year signed a new pact for automatic exchange of information about account details 2018 onwards, the pending requests have been made under their existing bilateral tax treaty. The pace of seeking such details seems to have quickened in recent months, going by the sudden spurt in the number of Indian names figuring in such notifications.

Gaurav Shroff,07-2017,'Tardigrades' can survive until the end of Earth: Study,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/14/tardigrades-earths-unlikely-beacon-of-life-that-can-survive-a-cosmic-catacylsm?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"The most resilient form of life on Earth, tardigrade, also known as water bear, will survive until the Sun dies, as per an Oxford University research. The eight-legged micro-animal can survive for 30 years without food or water, and endure temperature extremes from -270ÂºC to 150ÂºC. Further, tardigrades can withstand catastrophic events like large asteroid impacts, supernovae, and gamma-ray bursts.","Whether it is a supernova or an asteroid impact, should a cosmic calamity strike, it seems there will be at least one form of life left: a tubby, microscopic animal with the appearance of a crumpled hoover bag.The creatures, known as tardigrades, are staggeringly hardy animals, a millimetre or less in size, with species living in wet conditions that range from mountain tops to chilly ocean waters to moss and lichen on land.?They can survive incredible conditions ? we are talking close to absolute zero, the vacuum of space, exposure to radiation that would kill us, and these things just walk away from it like nothing happened,? said David Sloan, an astrophysicist from the University of Oxford.Now new research by Sloan and colleagues has shown that the creatures would survive any cosmic disaster that might conceivably be thrown at Earth ? a discovery that could have implications elsewhere in the solar system, and beyond. ?There are quite a lot of stars like our sun out there, and about 20% of these stars have an Earth-like planet around them,? said Sloan. ?What you then want to ask is if life started on one of these planets, what are the odds that it is still around??Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers describe how they probed the conundrum by exploring the likelihood of a variety of catastrophes serious enough to wipe out tardigrades on an Earth-like planet, including a nearby supernova, a burst of gamma-rays, and an impact by a large asteroid powerful enough to cause the oceans to boil away. But the team found that the chances of such events were so remote as to be extremely unlikely ? there was little chance of a supernova occurring close enough to an Earth-like planet to kill off the creatures, and it would take an impact from an asteroid or dwarf planet near the mass of Vesta for the oceans to boil. ?There are about 17 [asteroids] this big in our solar system, but they are all on sufficient orbits that they will never intersect with us,? said Sloan. The upshot, he said, was that it was very unlikely any cosmic event would be so catastrophic as to sterilise an Earth-like planet where life, of the sort we know, had got going. ?Because [tardigrades] are so hardy it means that events that we are worried about as human beings, and rightly so, certainly wouldn?t concern you if you just considered all life,? said Sloan. Matthew Cobb, professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, who was not involved in the study said the findings were reassuring for the future of life on Earth.?It suggests that the complete eradication of life on Earth is extremely unlikely until we get to the point that the sun enlarges and all the oceans boil away,? he said. ?Many organisms, in particular animals and bacteria, live in the deep ocean, which the authors show would be unaffected by any conceivable cosmic cataclysm.?Mark Blaxter, professor of evolutionary genomics at the University of Edinburgh, agreed, adding that there are other organisms have a similar survival strategy to tardigrades. What?s more, he said, there are also organisms that live very deep underground in hot water within continental and under-sea-floor rocks. ?Sterilising the planet would have to deal with these too,? he noted. He also stressed that even tardigrades are not invincible. ?[Land-based] tardigrades stay alive in extreme conditions by drying out completely. So if there was no water left ? there would be no ?live? tardigrades, just dried up ones,? said Blaxter. ?And if there was some water left so that the tardigrades could re-animate, if there was no food left they eat algae and fungi - they too would be dead in a couple of weeks.?Cobb, too, noted that even if the tardigrades were the only survivors, they would face a struggle. ?For the tardigrades to inherit the Earth, whatever catastrophe swept over the planet would have to return to normal-ish conditions within a matter of decades at most, or it really could be curtains,? he said."

This comes after an expert committee appointed by the NGT claimed that the ecology of over 420 acres of floodplains was adversely affected by the World Culture Festival organised in 2016 by the Art of Living.,"The restoration of Yamuna floodplains could start soon with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Friday directing the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and irrigation department of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh to submit an action plan within a week.A bench headed by NGT chairperson justice Swatanter Kumar formed a three-member committee comprising a senior official of the DDA and chief engineers of the irrigation department of Delhi and UP to prepare the plan. ?The committee shall submit an action plan with reference to floodplains of Yamuna where Art of Living?s event was held last year,? the bench said.The tribunal also directed the committee to consult and refer to the findings and suggestions of the expert panel, appointed by NGT earlier, before submitting the restoration action plan. A three-day Word Culture Festival was organised on the river?s floodplains by spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar?s Art of Living in March 2016. An expert committee appointed by the green body had claimed that the ecology of over 420 acres of floodplains was adversely affected by the event. The panel suggested that it would require over Rs 42 crore to execute the plan. Art of Living, however, had challenged the findings on multiple grounds and even appointed its own panel of experts to prepare a parallel report to substantiate their claims. ?Let the restoration work begin. The cost can be debited to the account of whoever is responsible for the damage. We can?t ask the DDA to sit on the report submitted by the expert committee,? the bench observed. The matter would be heard again on a day-to-day basis from July 28 onwards. The action plan would have to be submitted by July 28. The expert committee earlier appointed by the tribunal suggested they would need the help of aquatic plants and animals that once used to inhabit the river?s floodplains to fix the ecological damage. The report had stated that huge de-siltation and dredging would be required to ?physically? rehabilitate the network of wetlands and channels that were damaged and destroyed. The biological rehabilitation ? the process to make the wetlands and channels ecologically functional once again ? would have to be started simultaneously, experts had suggested.This process would take around 10 years at least."

The Phase IV will add over 100-km to Delhi Metro network."," The Delhi Metro, which has issued tenders for the topographical survey of its six lines under Phase 4 approved by Delhi government, plans to start construction by August. The lines under Phase 4, in addition to the 140 kilometres added in Phase 3, are expected to free up traffic bottlenecks in congested central and southern parts of the city, and help passengers from outer Delhi.Phase 3 of Metro?s expansion is likely to be completed by mid-2017.

Saurav Verma, 18, a student of Delhi University and resident of Kadipur village, has to wake up at 5 in the morning every alternate day, and wait an hour till the water tank is filled up. Verma, and most other residents of the village, say while the WiFi facility may have waited, the government should have first ensured regular water supply, an approach road and improved connectivity.Kadipur was declared a ?free Wi-Fi? village on June 19 by the local councillor Urmila Rana.

Children in the village anyway had mobile phones with internet facility. We are not dependent on government for WiFi,? he said.Anil Kashyap, another resident, said things have improved a bit.  ?There has been some development in the past few years. He said earlier the villagers have to wait five days for getting water supply.?He said improved connectivity will create better employment opportunities for the village youth, he said.Area councillor Urmila Rana said she has written to the Delhi government several times for improving the water supply but nothing has happened. ?I would have got the roads constructed but the corporation is yet to notify the newly drawn municipal zones because of which no development funds could be allocated.?Manoj Tiwari told Hindustan Times that it was for the Delhi government to take care of problems related to water and power. ?I have adopted the village and my funds will be used for the purpose. But I can only suggest or recommend the work but the government will have to do it. The problem persists because of the government?s non-cooperative attitude.

I think they have a problem with female sexuality being portrayed on screen. What the film?s success has done is that it has shown [the Censor Board] up, and what they thought about the film. I have seen the film twice, and it?s a wonderfully made film that talks about what?s going on in society. I don?t know why the Censor Board had a problem with that,? he quips. The CBFC letter informing the filmmakers that certification wouldn?t be given had called the film ?lady-oriented?, a perplexing word that drew much ridicule from filmmakers and actors. Afterwards, the Lipstick team got the required clearance from a parallel body. This has been one of the most high-profile tussles between the Censor Board and film teams in recent memory.With Lipstick?s release stalled for almost six months, director Alankrita Shrivastava and her team fought to get a clean chit, and finally received it from the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal, which asked for 16 cuts in the film. Naseeruddin Shah says, ?One has to ask a psychiatrist as to why they are afraid of [female sexuality] on screen. It?s very frightening to see that the Censor Board can do whatever it wants and practise its biases openly and ban films that it doesn?t like. But the success of such films prove that no one is bothered about what the Censor Board or the doubters think about [these] films.?Shah also criticises the Censor Board for being dictatorial. ?For starters,? he says, ?they are supposed to give a film a certificate; they are no authority to ban a film, or stay its release. But then they claim to be someone who can do that. Their narrow-minded approach affects the film industry. But nothing has been done about it.?Follow @htshowbiz for more "

""There is no need to start attacking him from the first day,"" he said. ""There's nothing objectionable in Yogi Adityanath holding a puja at CM's residence,"" he added.","The BJP's decision to appoint Yogi Aditynath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh has invited a range of reactions from its political rivals, with some slamming the choice yet others adopting a wait-and-watch approach.In a scenario like this, newly-anointed CM Yogi Adityanath has found support from an unusual quarter. Samajwadi Party leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Ram Gopal Yadav said one should give Yogi Adityanath at least six months to start work and deliver on the BJP's promises to people in Uttar Pradesh.""There is no need to start attacking him from the first day,"" said Ram Gopal Yadav as Gorakhpur MP Adityanath spent his first day in the chief minister's office today.WHAT RAM GOPAL YADAV HAD TO SAY ABOUT ADITYANATHRajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav, who helped nephew Akhilesh Yadav dethrone father Mulayam Singh Yadav from the SP president's post, said there was nothing objectionable in Yogi Adityanath holding a puja at his house before moving in.""Doing puja is a normal practice in Hindu tradition before starting on a new project,"" Ram Gopal Yadav said, reacting to reports on Yogi Adityanath getting a team of seven priests from Gorakhpur to perform puja at the CM's official residence at 5, Kalidas Marg in Lucknow.The Samajwadi Party leader also lauded Adityanath's directive to his ministers to declare their source of income and assets to the party and the chief minister's office within 15 days. FINGER-POINTING STARTS IN SAMAJWADI PARTYFollowing the Samajwadi Party's humiliating loss in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, finger pointing has begun and Ram Gopal Yadav could face some tough questions from party seniors. Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav was never in the favour of an alliance with the Congress and did not campaign for it during the election. However, once the election results were announced, father Mulayam Singh had defended son Akhilesh and said the responsibility for the defeat should not entirely fall on the young Yadav's shoulders.As father and son try to put up a united face after election, many expect the party to take some tough decisions to put the house in order.

""The stress will be on segregation of waste at source, composting of organic waste and recycling so that minimum possible garbage reaches landfill sites,"" Kumar said.","Five NDMC localities ? Jor Bagh, Pandara Park, Bapa Nagar, Kaka Nagar and Golf Links ? will be made zero waste colonies, the civic corporation?s chairman Naresh Kumar announced on Friday while presenting its annual budget of 2017-18.?This will be done in collaboration with local resident welfare associations. The stress will be on segregation of waste at source, composting of organic waste and recycling so that minimum possible garbage reaches landfill sites. We are working out the details. In a month or so, work will start on the ground,? Kumar told HT on Friday.In a zero waste colony, garbage is segregated into wet waste, dry waste and e-waste. Wet waste is then put in compost pits and e-waste sent to a recycle centre. The rag pickers will collect all the recyclable items from dry waste and the rest will go to the landfill site. This kind of waste segregation reduces the burden on landfill sites.Experts say that 50% of the garbage generated in a city is green waste that can be turned into compost. Another 30% can be recycled and only 20% should reach the landfills ideally.In some corners of the city ? in places like Dwarka, Defence Colony, Sarita Vihar, Preet Vihar and Dilshad Garden ? residents have already taken up composting in their community parks and have been segregating their domestic waste.The NDMC has also selected a concessionaire for scientific collection and disposal of construction and demolition waste through vehicles having radio frequency identification tags. ?The red colour bins were chosen to differentiate them from normal ones. We will install 10 bins with 10 tonne capacity and 20 with 5 tonne capacity. A concessionaire, Metro Waste Handling Limited, is removing the demolition waste from these bins and taking them to the Shashtri Park construction and demolition plant,? an official said.Delhi generates 5,000 tonnes of construction and demolition debris ? 40% of the total municipal waste - every day. Nearly half of this waste, from big and small construction sites, can be recycled but end up on the Yamuna riverbed, in our backyards, local water bodies, or at landfill sites.To boost mechanised sweeping, three more mechanical sweepers will be hired by the council. Over 1,800 more garbage bins will be installed in all major roads, markets, parks and gardens.Garbage woes10,000 - Tonnes is the daily garbage generation of Delhi50% - Waste is fit for composting30% - Waste is recyclable20% - Waste should reach landfillsHow you can reduce waste?If household waste is segregated and recycled it will reduce the waste by at least 60%Segregate: Separate wet and dry waste by keeping a bin for paper, glass, wood, cardboard and another one for food and kitchen wasteCompost: Set up community compost bins in your area. You can use the manure for plantsRecycle: Collect your paper and cardboard trash and sell them. Re-use as much plastic and glass as you canReduce: Avoid using items such sachets, aluminum foil and thermocol plates. Don?t wrap gifts.

The e-rickshaw drivers would be able to charge their vehicles at nominal prices during night.The location include  the North MCD parking lots near Badli Metro station, village Singhalpur (Haryana irrigation canal), Railway Reservation Office near Kela godown, Keshavpuram and Sector 11, Rohini.?Most of the parking lots remained vacant during the night. So, we have decided to appoint a contractor who will install the charging points at the selected parking lots, collect a minimal amount from e-rickshaws and allow them to charge their vehicles here,? said Praveen Gupta, commissioner, North MCD.The contractor will also be responsible for maintaining the ?law and order situation at these places? during the night when the e-rickshaws will be charged.According to Gupta, there are various reasons for starting the facility at selected parking lots .?We are choosing locations which are close to internal/arterial roads and far from the main stretches in city. The idea is to avoid jam on the main roads. We have also taken into account the demand for charging faciliyt. For example, there is long requirement for battery charging point for e-rickshaws near DRDO and Delhi University area that?s why among the six parking lots, one is located near DRDO office,? he said further.In future, the agency is also planning to open all the parking lots, developed near the Metro stations as charging points for e- rickshaws. ?This would include the six parking lots which would be developed in North Delhi on Delhi Metro Rail Corporation land. This will also help us to deal with unauthorised parking of vehicles on the roadside,? said a senior North MCD official. According to official, since the e-rickshaws drivers get their most customers from near the Metro stations, a charging facility nearby would be convenient to use for them. "

It is our economic freedom,"" he said. Ambani said there are moments in the life of a nation when history is made not in small steps of incremental gain but in giant leaps of ambition.

He said the free market is a force for generating wealth and transforming lives and the real promise of GST is promise of economic liberation. With the promise of One Nation, One Tax, One Market, it would create a borderless world of 1.3 billion people -- producers and consumers engaged in a seamless exchange of goods and services, skill sets and capital, labour and ideas. Ambani said the world has seen nothing like this before and in less than 48 hours, India will emerge as the biggest free and democratic market in the history of humankind. ""In tandem with its policy precursor -- demonetisation -- GST will forever change the ground rules of doing any kind of trade, commerce or business in India. "

""Economic growth in China has been on a downward trend since a brief rebound after the global financial crisis.

The three met as many as 82 people in just four months.Speaking to HT, RTI activist T Narasimha Murthy said allowing Sasikala and her relatives additional visits amounts to gross violation of rules. ?It is a known fact that poor inmates in the jail are not extended such privileges,? he added.Former deputy inspector general of police (prisons) Roopa D Moudgil had highlighted alleged violations at the Bengaluru prison on July 12. In a report, she said there were accusations that Sasikala had paid a bribe of Rs 2 crore to senior police officers ? including then director general of police (prisons) HN Sathyanarayana Rao. Subsequently, the state instituted a probe headed by retired Indian Administrative Services officer Vinay Kumar.Meanwhile, both Moudgil and Rao were transferred ?to ensure a fair investigation?.After visiting the jail, Kumar told reporters on Wednesday that he would not be able to comment on the terms of the inquiry and the timeline for submitting the report. ?The home department may inform the public once it is submitted,? he said.Murali Karnam, a researcher who has studied the condition of jails across India, said inequality in prison is just a reflection of the inequality that exists outside. ?Special privileges are sometimes accorded to wealthier prisoners by default, even without the payment of a bribe,? he added.Former director general of police (prisons) ST Ramesh said any information about Sasikala being allowed the alleged privileges was likely to influence public opinion. ?Even assuming that no bribe was paid, it would have been ideal if the prison department was more open. It should have informed the public about the pressures faced by them while handling a high-profile prisoner,? he added."

Continuous rains and lack of food were the chief causes behind the cows' death, according to officials quoted by PTI. The cows died over a the last few days, prompted senior officials, including Haryana Gau Sewa Commission chairman Bhani Das Mangla and a few district administration officials to visit the cow shelter in Mathana village where the deaths took place.

The engineer's discrimination lawsuit, filed last year, also claims harassment from men on the factory floor ""including... inappropriate language, whistling, and cat calls.""","A female engineer at Tesla has accused Elon Musk?s car company of ignoring her complaints of ?pervasive harassment?, paying her a lower salary than men doing the same work, promoting less qualified men over her and retaliating against her for raising concerns.The allegations of AJ Vandermeyden, who still works at the celebrated electric car manufacturer, paint a picture of a hostile work environment dominated by men where inappropriate sexual behavior is tolerated and women face numerous barriers to advance their careers.Vandermeyden, 33, shared her story with the Guardian at a time when Silicon Valley is reeling from the explosive allegations of former Uber engineer Susan Fowler. In a viral blogpost, she alleged that management and HR dismissed her complaints about documented sexual harassment and sexism, protected a repeat offender because he was a ?high performer? and suggested that women in the company were not as skilled as men.Offering a rare public account of discrimination from a tech worker who remains employed at her company, Vandermeyden said her dedication to Tesla motivated her to advocate for fair treatment and reforms ? despite the serious risks she knows she faces for going public. ?Until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she said in a recent interview, her first comments about a discrimination lawsuit she filed last year. ?I?m an advocate of Tesla. I really do believe they are doing great things. That said, I can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.? Vandermeyden began at Tesla in 2013 and was eventually promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in the general assembly department, which consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over, according to her complaint. It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to haveIt was common for her to be the only woman in meetings with 40 to 50 men, she said on a recent morning, seated in the living room of her family?s house in San Carlos, the city where Tesla was founded, located across the bay from its current factory in Fremont.Currently, all chief executive positions are held by men at Tesla, and out of more than 30 vice-presidents, only two are women, she added. ?It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have.?Vandermeyden said that when complaints arise at Tesla about workplace issues or inequality, the response is often: ??We?re focused on making cars. We don?t have time to deal with all this other stuff.??Tesla, founded in 2003, has gained international recognition for its battery-powered vehicles and ?autonomous? driving technology, promoted by Musk, the ambitious entrepreneur who makes headlines for bold pledges about space travel, artificial intelligence, underground tunnels and driverless cars.But Vandermeyden?s complaint, filed last fall, alleges that there were inadequacies in the quality testing of cars, and that she raised issues about the flaws she observed, which supervisors and male engineers had missed. Although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions above her, her lawyers wrote. She and other female engineers were denied promotions even though they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men, according to the complaint. At the same time, she also experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?, the lawsuit said. Vandermeyden recounted to the Guardian an incident in 2015 when she said a group of roughly 20 men standing on a platform above her and a female colleague began taunting as they walked past. ?They all started hooting and hollering and whistling,? she said. ?That can?t happen without somebody noticing ? It?s disturbing.? But her objections about sexual harassment and unequal pay only caused her more trouble, according to her complaint. The lawsuit alleges that after she raised concerns in the fall of 2015, management told her that in order to advance her position, she needed to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was unattainable and not expected of male engineers. Despite positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department where she continues to work today, according to her suit. The lawsuit said Tesla also denied her overtime pay, rest breaks and meal periods when she worked in sales, and retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower? when she raised concerns about cars ?sold in a defective state?.Some of her claims of mistreatment echo those that have recently emerged from Tesla factory workers, who allege that they have to work long hours for low wages in unsafe conditions. Musk has vigorously denied those claims and criticized an effort by workers to unionize. Tesla initially declined to respond to the Guardian?s questions about Vandermeyden?s claims, but after publication of this report, released a statement on Tuesday defending its actions and refuting her allegations. A spokesperson said that Tesla had hired a ?neutral third party? last year to investigate her accusations and that an ?exhaustive review of the facts? concluded her ?claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have not been substantiated?.The company added in its statement: ?Tesla is committed to creating a positive workplace environment that is free of discrimination for all our employees.?Therese Lawless, Vandermeyden?s lawyer, criticized the investigation, saying, ?We did not believe that it was a comprehensive report ... We vehemently disagree with their finding.?Vandermeyden?s suit said she has suffered ?mental distress? and ?humiliation?.In an interview, she said it takes a toll on her knowing that her work is undervalued. ?Equal pay is something that is essentially in the back of your mind every single day,? she said. ?You have all these data points showing how you?ve exceeded some of the predecessors and improved on the system. It wears on you.? It?s very difficult for women to come forward. They?re concerned that their career is going to be jeopardizedMany women in similar positions choose not to speak up, Lawless said. ?It?s very difficult for women to come forward. They?re concerned that their career is going to be hindered or jeopardized.? For those who do raise complaints, dealing with HR can be a painful struggle, added Lawless, who represented former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.?Most of my clients come in and say, ?human resources isn?t helping me. They?re just protecting the company.?? Vandermeyden recently took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the Model S Tesla car and has a reservation for the upcoming Model 3. She is hopeful her lawsuit and public comments won?t end her career at a company she loves: ?I think they?re a revolutionary and innovative company.?But she admitted she has doubts about her future. ?Half the time when I walk into work, I wonder if my badge is going to work.?

Uzzaman claims Hill accused him of sexual misconduct in the post to damage his reputation. Uzzaman's attorneys said the blog post was traced to the IP address of his rival's house.,"An anonymous blogpost accusing a Silicon Valley venture capitalist of sexual misconduct was written by a male executive who pretended to be a female victim of harassment in order to damage the reputation of a competitor, according to a lawsuit.The complaint filed by Anis Uzzaman, a prominent tech investor and CEO of Fenox Venture Capital, alleged that a male rival CEO published a fake online account purporting to be an unnamed woman who was ?sexually taken advantage of? by Uzzaman. The blogpost, which said Uzzaman pressured the author to go to his hotel room after a business meeting, was written by Brandon Katayama Hill, founder and CEO of a San Francisco branding and marketing agency called Btrax that competes with Fenox, according to the suit. Uzzaman?s attorneys said the blogpost was traced to the IP address of Hill?s home. Reached for comment on Thursday, Hill denied that he was the author of the post, claiming that other people had access to his wifi and that he did not know who wrote it. The lawsuit comes at a time when women across Silicon Valley have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment following a viral account of misconduct and discrimination at Uber. Over the past month, there has been increasing scrutiny of venture capitalists following a series of stories alleging that powerful male investors have repeatedly harassed women seeking startup funding, who are particularly vulnerable and have few recourses to raise concerns when they are mistreated or assaulted by VCs.Uzzaman?s lawyers have alleged that Hill took advantage of the discussion about discrimination in the industry to target a rival. ?To have these false accusations come particularly in this climate when there?s this growing awareness of a problem that does exist, it?s damaging,? Katrina Saleen, Uzzaman?s attorney, told the Guardian. ?It?s also an insult to true victims of sexual harassment ? It makes people question the veracity of true victims, which is harmful.? According to the complaint, the blogpost, titled ?I was sexually taken advantage of by a Silicon Valley VC?, was published in March on a popular Japanese blog site, Hatena. The post said the author met the ?very famous? VC at a local startup event and that he asked her to meet and talk about business. The VC invited the woman to go on a trip with her and stay at a five-star hotel, and when she refused, he said: ?You are going to lose the biggest opportunity if you do not come,? according to the post. The VC said he might invest in her and pressured her to go to his hotel that night, but she refused, the post said. Later, he stopped communicating with her, saying: ?I?m busy, don?t contact me.? ?A lot of people from Japan, including students, and many very cute girls come to him, and he takes advantage of them,? said the blogpost, which was written in Japanese and translated to English in the complaint. The blog did not name Uzzaman but he was easily identifiable, according to the complaint. There are only a few Silicon Valley companies that do venture capital services for Japan, and Fenox is the only firm which has a non-Japanese leader with ?dark skin? who is fluent in Japanese, as the blog outlined, the suit said. The comments section referenced Fenox and Uzzaman, according to the complaint. A Japanese court eventually ordered Hatena to produce the IP address traced to the article, and attorneys confirmed through Comcast that the post, published on a Saturday morning, was linked to the home address of Hill, the suit said. Hill?s company has offices in California and Japan and operates in the ?same general domain? as Uzzaman?s firm, working with startups funded by Japanese corporations, the complaint said.Hill also used to run a San Francisco startup competition called Japan Night, and Fenox Venture Capital last year launched a similar event called Startup World Cup. The blogpost was published weeks before the event.?This event is very important to them. For this to have come out just before ? is damaging,? said Saleen.In a short phone interview, Hill said he had not yet seen the complaint, which was filed last week in San Mateo superior court, adding: ?I didn?t write the article. I?m not responsible for it. This is a false allegation.? Hill further claimed that more than 50 people had access to his wifi, though he declined to identify them. He also declined to comment on whether he had suspicions on who may have authored the blogpost. He further claimed that his firm did not compete with Fenox: ?We are in totally different businesses.?Asked about Hill?s denial, Saleen said: ?Comcast has confirmed that the IP address that the blog was posted from is from Brandon Hill?s home ? We?ve also confirmed that he has password-protected wifi.? Through his attorney, Uzzaman declined to comment. "

To their credit they stuck with what was right and it all worked. Don't forget the contributions from Nathan Lyon. The wicket was extremely dry and it looked like it would turn from day one,"" Clarke said.Clarke also criticised India's sloppy fielding in the match.Smith, who was unbeaten on 59 overnight, was dropped three times on Friday and was handed another lifeline on 67 but maintained his concentration on a tricky surface to bring up his 18th Test hundred.He also enjoyed another slice of fortune on 73 when a strong appeal for leg before off Jadeja was turned down by the umpire with replays indicating the decision would have been overturned on review had India not already used up their two referrals."

The priest at Shri Hanuman Balaji Temple in Gyan Khand-4 in Indirapuram has put up information on the donation box of the temple asking devotees to pay through Paytm. According to the temple priest, the move was initiated because the amount of donations fell after demonetisation was announced on November 8.?When the note ban was announced many people donated old notes. In November,  since many were donating Rs500 or Rs1,000 notes, we did not have to worry much as we would then deposit them with the bank.

Hindus have started opting for electric cremation as there may not be enough trees to get wood for cremation. What can be the substitute for Muslims,"" it observed. During the hearing, the bench also asked the Waqf Board counsel to go and inspect the structures at the park and inform it which of these were pre-existing and which ones were new. ""We will protect only the old structures. New structures are not liable to be protected. We are here to see that the law is abided by,"" it said and listed the matter for further hearing on July 10. The bench also asked the authorities to remove debris from the demolished structures in the park. The court had earlier observed that the right to life of residents cannot be put to risk by allowing encroachments, which could lead to insanitary conditions. "

(road blockade protest).Indian National Lok Dal party workers during the SYL protest at Saddopur barrier, locate don the border of Punjab and Haryana, on Monday.

						The INLD said that it is seeking the immediate construction of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal in Punjab to bring more water to Haryana, and said that its protest will continue till 3 pm this afternoon.Media reported that scores of INLD activists hoodwinked the Haryana Police and central security forces and blocked National Highway One near Ambala.

Ambulances and fire brigades, however, were allowed to pass.Inter-state bus services in both Punjab and Haryana were suspended till 5 p.m. today as a precautionary measure, causing inconvenience to commuters.Security personnel in riot gear, riot-control vehicles and other equipment were patrolling key points in both states to maintain law and order.Vehicles are being stopped on the Lalru-Chandigarh stretch, Ambala-Shambhu border, Narwana-Dhanauri border, Ratia-Budhlada Road (Jakhal point) in Fatehabad district and Dabwali in Sirsa district.The Supreme Court had on November 11, 2016 declared the Punjab government law (passed in 2004) that it will not share water with Haryana as ?unconstitutional?.It also directed Punjab to mobilise a central agency to take control of the canal works immediately and complete it expeditiously.Immediately after the decision, Punjab government de-notified the land and even returned Haryana?s share back, stating that it cannot share even a single drop of water. The Haryana government moved the Supreme Court and the court stayed Punjab Government proceedings.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had expressed the hope that the contentious issue could be resolved through dialogue. Punjab has been maintaining that it does not have surplus waters to share with Haryana.The Sutlej-Yamuna Link is a proposed 214-kilometer-long canal to connect the Sutlej River in Punjab and the Yamuna River in Haryana. Both states, however, have repeatedly created obstacles, which has prevented the project from taking off.

Notably, driving cycles estimate how much pollution a vehicle is emitting and its fuel consumption. The plan will be pursued with the money which manufacturers and dealers deposited with the Board over the last one year as Environment Protection Charge.","Delhi could become the first city in the country to have its own ?driving cycle? and location-specific air quality management plans, which would help in tackling the city?s rising pollution levels. Driving cycle gives an idea as to how much pollution a vehicle is emitting and its fuel consumption while travelling from one point to another in a city. It depends on various factors such as road conditions, vehicular speed and engine health among others. A better driving cycle denotes less pollution. ?The Central Pollution Control Board is planning to develop a Delhi-specific driving cycle and location-specific air quality management plans with the money which manufacturers and dealers have deposited with it over the past one year as Environment Protection Charge,? said a senior official of the CPCB. On August 12, 2016 the Supreme Court had directed all dealers and manufacturers to deposit 1% levy of ex-showroom price for every diesel car and SUV with engine capacity 2000cc and above sold in Delhi-NCR as environment protection charge. The CPCB was directed to open bank accounts where the money could be deposited. ?More than Rs 35 crore has already been deposited over the past one year. We have submitted a proposal to National Green Tribunal on how to use the money. As the entire money was collected from Delhi-NCR as per directions of the Supreme Court, it would be spent solely to better tackle air pollution in the region only,? said the official. Even though several countries in the US and Europe have already developed such city specific driving cycles to tackle air pollution, India is yet to come up with a driving cycle. ?This is a very good proposal. If we get to know the driving cycle of Delhi it would help us to bring down the pollution levels by doing away with those elements on the roads which cause pollution,? said Kamal Soi member of the National Road Safety Council. The CPCB is also planning to take the help of more advanced monitoring systems such as satellite imageries, sensor-based instrument and strengthen its existing ambient air quality and noise monitoring network with the accumulated fund. According the proposal submitted to the NGT plans are also afoot to install LED display screens in some locations for creating awareness among the citizens on the rising air pollution levels of Delhi. ?We would also invite  expression of interest where in research activities on how to retrofit vehicles with advanced technologies and alternate cleaner fuels could be funded,? the CPCB official said.

They are enjoying monopoly and flouting all rules. At present, they are not bound by any rules and surge pricing is still levied on us,? said Ajay Anand, another regular user.Last year, Uber had introduced ?upfront fare? under which the company calculates and shows rates depending on expected time and distance of travel and local traffic. The fares fluctuate due to demand.The company, which operates in 29 Indian cities, counts India as its second largest market, after the US. Affordable pricing has been one of the important factors driving the uptake of on-demand taxi services in the country. "

The latest incident took place at a Pragya Kendra, a government-run service centre that offer facilities such as linking Aadhaar number with other documents, issuing caste certificates, voter ID cards and PAN cards. When people turned up at the common service centre with their respective requisitions on Wednesday morning, they allegedly found Ansari half-naked with a woman at the Heena Market Pragya Kendra.He was dragged out of the office premises and beaten with sticks, belts, shoes and slippers by the mob.Ansari fell unconscious after the assault, but the mob continued thrashing him until the police intervened, sources said.The police rushed Ansari to the Bokaro General Hospital. He was yet to regain consciousness, doctors said.Bokaro deputy superintendent of police Poonam Minz said that the police have lodged an unnamed first information report against the mob, and arrested one Mantu Yadav in connection with the case.?We have arrested one, and are scanning the CCTV footage to identify others who assaulted the man,? she said.In April, a 25-year-old man was beaten to death in Saraikela Kharsawan for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl. On June 8, a 45-year-old man was lynched for allegedly raping a widow in Palamu and on June 27, another man was beaten to death by a mob for allegedly raping an eight-year-old girl in Dumka.Police deployed additional security forces across the affected area to prevent the incident from snowballing into a communal conflagration.?Rumour-mongers on social media too are under our scanner,? said a Bokaro police official working with the cyber cell of the district."

The party said the country remembers Sena founder Bal Thackeray who took a tough stand against any kind of attacks on the Amarnath Yatra that ensured its smooth functioning for the next 20-25 years. The Shiv Sena had on Tuesday condemned the attacks on Amarnath yatra pilgrims in Kashmir, saying now was the time for the government to show the might of the much-touted 56-inch chest. Seven people died in the attacks while several others were injured.The party in the editorial said, ?All this was happening during the Congress government?s rule and so the public elected a change to have a courageous government.

It also stated ""jokes drawing attention to someone's differences"" is a potential form of ""everyday racism"".","London, Apr 24 (PTI) Oxford University students who avoid making eye contact with their peers could be guilty of racism, according to the prestigious varsitys latest guidance. The universitys Equality and Diversity Unit has advised undergraduate students that ""not speaking directly to people"" could be deemed a ""racial micro-aggression"" which can lead to ""mental ill-health"", The Telegraph reported. Issued at the start of the Trinity term, the third term at the university, the newsletter claims that asking someone where they are ""originally"" from implies they are a foreigner. It also claims that ""jokes drawing attention to someones differences"" and ""not speaking directly to people"" are potential forms of ""everyday racism"". The universitys Equality and Diversity Unit explains in the newsletter that ""some people who do these things may be entirely well-meaning, and would be mortified to realise that they had caused offence."" ""But this is of little consequence if a possible effect of their words or actions is to suggest to people that they may fulfil a negative stereotype, or do not belong,"" it states. However, some critics slammed the newsletter, saying it would make the students over sensitive. Dr Joanna Williams, a lecturer in higher education at the University of Kent, said the guidance was ""completely ridiculous"" and will make students ""hyper-sensitive"" about how they interact with one another. ""Essentially people are being accused of a thought crime. They are being accused of thinking incorrect thoughts based on an assumption of where they may or may not be looking,"" she said. Williams, who is author of Academic Freedom in an Age of Conformity, said that Oxford Universitys guidance was ""overstepping the mark"" by telling students ""how they should feel and think"". Tom Slater, co-coordinator of The Free Speech University Ranking project that highlights censorship on university campuses, called it ridiculous to suggest that not looking someone in the eye was a micro form of racism. ""This is all part of a chilling desire on the part of university authorities to police not just opinions, but everyday conversations between students,"" he told The Times. An Oxford University spokesman was quoted as saying that, ""The Equality and Diversity Unit works with University bodies to ensure that the Universitys pursuit of excellence goes hand in hand with freedom from discrimination and equality of opportunity.""

Yash Kumar,12-2016,Wonder Woman loses job as UN ambassador,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/12/wonder-woman-un-ambassador-gender-equality?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other ,"DC Comics character Wonder Woman will be removed from her position as an honorary UN ambassador for women empowerment on Friday, following protests over her appointment two months ago. UN staff members protested over her ""overtly sexualized image"" and slammed the UN's inability to ""find a real-life woman"" who would champion the rights of women on issues of gender equality.","The UN has dropped the superhero Wonder Woman as an ambassador for empowering girls and women after a brief stint that drew widespread criticism.The campaign around the comic book character, who turned 75 this autumn, lasted for less than two months. Among its key aims were challenging female stereotypes and fighting discrimination and violence against women and girls.But the appointment prompted an angry backlash from some quarters. More than 44,000 people signed a petition that claimed to have been started by ?concerned United Nations staff members? which called on the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to appoint a non-fictional woman to the role.?It is alarming that the United Nations would consider using a character with an overtly sexualised image at a time when the headline news in United States and the world is the objectification of women and girls,? the petition?s authors wrote.Her scanty clothing ? ?a shimmery, thigh-baring bodysuit with an American flag motif and knee-high boots? ? meant that deploying her as a role model for the UN was culturally insensitive in many parts of the world, the petition added.Wonder Woman?s tenure as an honorary ambassador was launched on 21 October with an event that saw a silent protest by audience members who turned their backs on the panel, which included current and former Wonder Woman actors Gal Gadot and Lynda Carter.Others protested in the lobby, holding up signs that said ?I?m not a mascot? and ?Let?s get real?.Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment, the Warner Bros subsidiary behind Wonder Woman, told the event the campaign would feature various initiatives ?over the course of the next year?, suggesting that the partnership was envisaged to last into 2017.But now the UN has confirmed Wonder Woman?s time as an honorary ambassador will end this week. ?From the UN?s side, there was no plan for it to be much longer than this,? said Jeffrey Brez, the UN?s chief of NGO relations and advocacy.DC Entertainment had approached the UN to explore a joint project to mark the character?s 75th birthday, Brez said. The campaign aimed to harness Wonder Woman?s popularity to allow the UN to target new audiences with its messages on equality for women and girls.The angry response in some quarters prompted the UN to make celebrating the achievements of ?real-life Wonder Women? one of the campaign?s core goals.The collaboration had lasted longer than previous UN roles given to fictional characters, Brez added, pointing out that a character from the video game Angry Birds served as climate change ambassador for a single day in March.Other fictional characters to have been given honorary roles include Winnie the Pooh as honorary ambassador for friendship in 1997, and Tinkerbell as honorary ambassador for ?green? to promote environmental awareness in 2009.Warner Bros and DC Entertainment have been ?extremely pleased? with the partnership?s role in raising awareness of the empowerment of women and girls, a spokeswoman said.?Wonder Woman stands for peace, justice and equality, and for 75 years she has been a motivating force for many and will continue to be long after the conclusion of her UN honorary ambassadorship.?"

This comes after Russia's gold medallist Tatyana Chernova lost her appeal against a retrospective ban for taking steroids. Ennis-Hill, who had won gold medals in Berlin in 2009 and Beijing in 2015, said, ""Triple world champion. Wow!""","Jessica Ennis-Hill will finally get her hands on the 2011 world championships gold medal originally denied her by the Russian drugs cheat Tatyana Chernova at a special ceremony at next month?s world championships in London. The news was confirmed when Chernova lost her appeal against a retrospective ban for taking steroids at the court of arbitration for sport. It means Ennis-Hill becomes a three-times world heptathlon champion, to go along with her Olympic gold and silver medals.The Guardian has also learned that the number of medallists who will be re-allocated medals at London 2017 will be significantly increased to include non-British athletes, with discussions taking place about when to hold the special ceremonies. The original plan had been to put them all on the morning of 11 August but they may now run over several days.When the news was broken to her coach Toni Minichiello, he replied: ?Alle-bloody-luia. It?s excellent news ? I thought the fillibustering would go on for ever. It just adds credence to my belief that she is the best female athlete Britain has ever produced.?Minichiello also welcomed the news that international athletes, too, cheated out of medals by drugs cheats would be rewarded. ?That?s a fitting decision ? because this is not just a British result but an international one. Maybe they should cancel one day of the athletics devote it to all the medal ceremonies they will need??Ennis-Hill won gold medals in Berlin in 2009 and Beijing in 2015 but could finish only second in Daegu in 2011, 129 points behind Chernova. Last year, before the Russian?s appeal to CAS, Ennis-Hill posted a picture of the Russian beating her on Instagram in 2011 before writing: ?This image was forever imprinted on my mind! However much it drove me on for what I was about to achieve in my first Olympics in London in my heart I just knew it was wrong. So happy to be finally receiving my gold medal. Triple world champion.

The story of Wang Qi, a Chinese army surveyor who strayed into India in January 1963 and subsequently imprisoned until 1969, was recently reported by the BBC.","China's State media has urged India to take steps to enable a former Chinese soldier, who has been residing in Madhya Pradesh after being imprisoned shortly after the 1962 war, to return to China to visit his family.The story of Wang Qi, who was a Chinese army surveyor who strayed into India in January 1963 and subsequently imprisoned until 1969, has garnered increasing attention in China after a report last week by the BBC describing his life in the village of Tirodi, in MP, and his desire to return to visit his family.On Friday, the Global Times, a widely-read Party run newspaper published by the People's Daily, strongly urged India to issue relevant documents to allow Wang, who reports said is now in his eighties, to return on humanitarian grounds. Wang was issued a passport by the Chinese Embassy in 2003 but denied permission to travel to see his ailing mother, who died in 2006.The Global Times said: ""Wang's story caused quite a stir on China's social media and appeals are rising that the man should be helped back home as soon as possible.

It is high time for the Indian authorities to take the case seriously and process it efficiently. If Wang's hope for a reunion with his family in China is shattered in India's red tape, that will hurt the feelings of a massive number of Chinese netizens.""The paper cited the case of two veteran Chinese soldiers, captured in 1962, who were returned in 2003 in what was ""conceived as a goodwill gesture that both countries hoped would lead them out of the shadow of the 1962 war.""""Although it's unclear whether Wang is a prisoner of war, it is inhumane to have isolated the elderly man from his family for such a long time,"" the Global Times said. ""The Indian authorities should give their utmost attention to this case, actively communicating with the Chinese Embassy and improving administrative efficiency in processing this case, while the Chinese side should cooperate to provide the necessary documents pertaining to Wang that India requires.""WANG ALIAS RAJ BAHADURThe BBC reported that Wang said he had strayed into India while carrying out land surveying duties for the Chinese army, and picked up by the Indian Red Cross Society.He was jailed and transferred around several Indian states before being released in 1969 and sent to the remote village of Tirodi, which is a five hour drive from Nagpur.

Here is our Rangoon movie review.Rangoon Cast: Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali KhanRangoon Direction: Vishal BhardwajRangoon Rating:Â  (3.5/5)When Rusi Bilmoria (Saif Ali Khan), an ex-film star who has been just a producer since an on-set accident, finds out that his fiance, the love of his life Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut), also the top star of his company, has cheated on him with a soldier, Jamadar Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), he turns his head silently towards his woman and looks at her with eyes red with grief, shock and the rage of a thousand suns.If you thought Saif Ali Khan's best moment in the movies till date was the scene in Omkara where he, Langda Tyagi, looks and keeps looking at Ajay Devgn in disbelief when Omkara (Ajay Devgn) makes Kesu (Vivek Oberoi) his political successor; well, stop right there. Saif has outdone his Omkara moment with the aforementioned scene from Rangoon. That alone is worth the price of the ticket.That and the beautiful, almost feral chemistry between the loyal soldier of the British Indian Army, Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), and '40s queen of the Indian big screen Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut).ALSO SEE: Before Rangoon's Julia, meet the original 'Hunterwali'Rangoon is a triangular love story between Nawab, Julia and Rusi. The story begins in 1943 in India when the British Army requests Rusi Bilmoria to send his beloved, Miss Julia, to the Indo-Burma border so that she can entertain the nation's soldiers. Rusi, a nation-lover, does his duty and sends off Julia with his troupe plus Nawab Malik as Julia's personal security. When the Japanese bomb them on their way, Malik and Julia manage to escape into Burma and, well, love blooms.Vishal Bhardwaj's most expensive and, of late, his most accessible film Rangoon sails smoothly as long its hero and heroine are allowed to just be. Malik and Julia's romance is slow-cooked and the essence of every moment between the two is allowed to linger before the next moment starts. It feels like Nawab Malik and Julia are floating in their own dreamland, perfectly content with the scheme of things, and consequently, Rangoon appears to feel content with itself, devoid of any duties to formal narrative storytelling. There is no rush to fast-forward to the next plot device in this entire stretch where Malik and Julia's romance is built up.Watch Yeh Ishq Hai from Rangoon here:Therefore, in the second half, when Vishal Bhardwaj and Co. pull up their socks to tie all the loose ends and ensure that all three protagonists - Malik, Julia and Rusi - find poetic justice, regardless of how laborious that pursuit might look on screen, Rangoon slowly, slowly bends and breaks its back under the pressure of Vishal Bhardwaj's narrative ambitions.ALSO SEE: Will Rangoon prove to be another Queen for Kangana Ranaut?Rangoon is gorgeous-looking with great cinematography (Pankaj Kumar, take a bow), fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography (Farah Khan, Sudesh Adhana). Love-making in the mud has never looked (and probably, never will) this sexy in a mainstream Hindi film. All that is fine. Where Rangoon does a bloody fail is its attempt to see through its two parallel narrative strands finding a common end: one, the love story, and the other, the war-conspiracy backdrop with the British Indian Army and Subhas Chandra Bose's INA mixed up.Vishal Bhardwaj, caught with the duty to serve two movies in one (an old-school romance and a war thriller), doesn't really do a Casablanca though he does give Rangoon his best shot. Nevertheless, Rangoon comes off as probably 2017's most good-looking and well-made Indian film. Certainly, this year's most ambitious, with three great lead performances. Vishal Bhardwaj is in fine form, mostly. And yes, the National Anthem comes thrice in the film.

Now, that?s not available.A photograph of the school which has 34 children clearly shows that the room in which they are studying is a toilet that was built by the government.

The change in fielding restrictions in the last 10 overs of a one-day international has eased the pressure on the bowlers a little bit, but only a little bit,"" he said.""...but for the most part, the bowlers are pretty much second-class citizens in white-ball cricket,"" he added.Bond said it is this imbalance which has led to spinners using negative tactics.""The slow bowlers specifically are resorting to a more negative line of bowling, not because they want to but because they have to,"" he said.""In an era gone by, the pattern was to tee-off in the first 15 overs, build through the middle of the innings and then launch a final onslaught. That philosophy has now gone out the window,"" he explained.Bond said bowlers cannot do without variety in the current scenario where every alternate game ends up being a run feast.""The yorker is not just one of the most difficult balls to bowl, the margin for error is also extremely small. Therefore, it becomes vital to use that weapon judiciously.""You must have the ability to change the length? bowl the yorker, yes, but also use the bouncer, the slower ball, the length ball,"" he opined.""You dont bowl the full ball to certain batsmen, you dont bang it in to certain others. All of it is very much opposition, ground, conditions and batter-dependent. If you are off even marginally, the yorker is probably the easiest ball to hit for a four or a six. You have to weigh up risk against reward,"" he said.Bond said bowlers in modern cricket should mix it up to make it difficult for the batsman to settle down."

Roshan had suffered serious brain injuries in the accident. ""Roshan is not at the border to protect the country. But... he served the nation by saving six lives,"" said his uncle. ","He could not serve the nation and its people while alive. But in death, 22-year-old ITBP recruit Roshan Kumar became the saviour for half a dozen families. Days after he received news of his first posting with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Uttarakhand native died in a road accident last week in Delhi's Dwarka area where he was visiting relatives. But six of his vital organs became life-savers for as many transplant patients at hospitals in the Capital. India has a huge gap in demand and supply of organs. Experts say many people are unwilling to donate relatives' organs due to religious beliefs, because they don't understand how it works, or because it is too difficult to do so due to red tape. Roshan belonged to an army background, and was brought up by an uncle. ""When he was just one year old, his parents died. I looked after him. From his very childhood and schooldays he wanted to become a soldier and serve the country. For this, he worked very hard. His dream was about to become reality. Now Roshan is not at the border to protect the country. But I am proud to say that he served the nation by saving six lives,"" Roshan's uncle told Mail Today, requesting anonymity. According to government data, about 2 lakh people are waitlisted for kidneys and 30,000 for livers. Legal donations meet about 3 to 5 per cent of the demand. ROSHAN WAS HIT BY A SPEEDING BIKEIn desperation, some patients on the waiting list seek the services of middlemen to procure organs for money illegally. Dr AK Rai, medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, told Mail Today, ""Last week, late night we received a call from a Dwarka-based hospital that they were referring a severely injured accident patient to us. We activated our expert team as the patient had very little chance of survival. Even in the time of grief, family members of the deceased agreed to donate the organs of their young son to fulfil his only wish to serve the country."" Roshan was on foot when he was hit by a speeding bike and fell, receiving serious brain injuries.Doctors retrieved the organs in quick time. ""After the patient was declared brain dead and the family agreed to donate his all organs, experts' team from NOTTO (National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation) and Safdarjung Hospital started the procedure of organ retrieval,"" said (Prof) Dr Anup Kumar, head of renal transplant department at Safdarjung. HE SERVED HIS NATION IN DEATH""All potential organs such as eyes, heart, liver, kidneys and intestine were procured, which gave fresh lease of life to six patients. Two people got eyes and one patient at AIIMS received the heart. Two patients got kidneys, one got a liver and the intestines were sent to Medanta hospital."" Roshan's act is a message of brotherhood and harmony for the nation, say doctors. ""He is a gem,"" Dr Kumar said. ""One of his kidneys was transplanted to a Muslim patient at Safardjung Hospital who was on dialysis for two years and could not find any donor."" Speaking to Mail Today, 47-year-old Parvez Alam who stays at Khanpur in south Delhi, said, ""I am blessed that I have received a kidney from a Hindu patient who was brain dead. Roshan proved Hindu-Muslim Bhai Bhai. I was searching for a kidney for the past two years, but the miracle happened when I was in the last stage of dialysis. May Roshan's soul rest in peace."" On Tuesday, Safdarjung Hospital felicitated Roshan's family. ""If a person is dedicated to fulfil his dreams, he or she can do it even when not alive,"" said Dr Sangeeta Sehrawat, organ retrieval coordinator at the institute.

The annual 'Country Report on Terrorism' said, ""Pakistan did not take sufficient action"" against the groups and did not limit their ability to threaten US interests in Afghanistan.","Pakistan remained in the dock in the Trump administration?s first worldwide assessment of terrorism and related threats, released on Wednesday, for not doing enough to combat terrorist groups and individuals operating from its soil.The state department?s 2016 Country Reports on Terrorism named Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad(JeM), the two groups behind most terror attacks in India, and the Haqqani network, which has attacked US-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, as organisations that operate from Pakistan havens. In language lifted almost word-for-word from its previous iterations, the latest report said, ?Pakistan did not take sufficient action against other externally focused groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad in 2016, which continued to operate, train, organise, and fundraise in Pakistan.?The report stated further, ?The Pakistani military and security forces undertook operations against groups that conducted attacks within Pakistan such as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (but they) did not take substantial action against the Afghan Taliban or HQN (Haqqani network), or substantially limit their ability to threaten US interests in Afghanistan??As before, Pakistan figured on the list of countries in the report that the US says provide safe haven to terrorist groups such as Haqqani Network, LeT and JeM. ?Although LeT is banned in Pakistan,? it said, ?LeT?s wings Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation (FiF) were able to openly engage in fundraising, including in the capital,? it said. The report said Indian authorities continued to blame Pakistan for cross-border attacks in Jammu and Kashmir. ?In January, India experienced a terrorist attack against an Indian military facility in Pathankot, Punjab, which was blamed by authorities on JeM,? the report said. Worldwide, the Islamic State remained ?the most potent terrorist threat to global security?, the report said, ?with eight recognised branches and numerous undeclared networks operating beyond the group?s core concentration in Iraq and Syria?.And, the report added, ?Iran remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism in 2016 as groups supported by Iran maintained their capability to threaten US interests and allies.? Read |?US looks to cut aid to Pakistan, other client nations in coming budgetIn terms of the number of terrorist attacks, an appendix prepared for the state department by an outside body found a dip. ?The total number of terrorist attacks in 2016 decreased by 9% and total deaths due to terrorist attacks decreased by 13%, compared to 2015. This was largely due to fewer attacks and deaths in Afghanistan, Syria, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Yemen.?The observations on Pakistan were almost the same as observations in the country reports for 2015, for instance, reflecting a continuity from the previous Obama administration that had in August 2016 punished Pakistan for its patchy counter-terrorism by withholding $300 million in defence aid.Earlier that year, the US Senate had come together in a bipartisan effort to kill a proposal for a subsidised sale of eight new F-17 combat jets to Pakistan for exactly the same reason ? not acting resolutely enough against terrorists based on its soil.The Trump administration has already indicated its views on Pakistan?s counter-terrorism efforts are no different. National Security Adviser HR McMaster delivered that message directly to the Pakistani leadership during a visit to Islamabad in April, emphasising ?the need to confront terrorism in all its forms?.President Donald Trump has personally not weighed in on this yet, but his remarks on Twitter from 2012 may point to his thinking: ?Get it straight. Pakistan is not our friend? When will Pakistan apologize to us for providing safe sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden for 6 years?! Some ?ally?.? "

His characters present a narrative and leave it to the audiences to decide if they want to support or oppose their stand. In fact, it?s his objectivity that makes Rannvijay Singh and Paan Singh (Irrfan in Haasil and Paan Singh Tomar) memorable characters. He operates within the same boundaries in Raag Desh (a classical Hindutsani raga with patriotic sentiments) as well. We know the story of Subhash Chandra Bose?s Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj, INA) and how it became a major player in India?s struggle for independence before Bose?s sudden disappearance from Rangoon. We have also heard the stories of three decorated officers of the INA, Shah Nawaz Khan (Kunal Kapoor), Prem Sehgal (Mohit Marwah) and Gurbaksh Dhillon (Amit Sadh), and how they turned into the symbol of unity in diversity during a court case against the British government two years before the Indian independence. Watch: Our Facebook Live discussion on Mubarakan, Indu Sarkar and Raag DeshRaag Desh is a detailed break-down of this famous case which revealed how vulnerable the British regime had become. It was also important because Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi were taking interest in the case. Probably they knew that the trial of three officers will have a favourable impact on Congress? demand for complete sovereignty.It?s an interesting premise. The film claims that close to 25 lakh Indians fought for the British Army in the World War Two. Out of these, 40,000 Indians surrendered to Japan after its win over Britain in Burma and nearby areas. The Japanese government later made the Indian troops collaborators in their war against the allied forces. An Indian officer, Mohan Singh, was appointed the incharge of this troop, but later Subhash Chandra Bose (played by Kenny Basumatary) took control and gave birth to the INA.The actual film begins when trials start and the British regime decides to handle it with an iron fist. Raag Desh finds its flow here and Tigmanshu Dhulia slowly absorbs us into the terrific detailing of the case. Bhula Bhai Desai (Kenneth Desai), a lawyer on the verge of retirement, helps Dhulia in getting the perfect narrative tone for the film.Disgusted with the Congress which refused to give him a ticket to contest the general elections, Bhula Bhai puts aside his differences with Nehru to plead the case of three men whose patriotism is dependent on one ruling.However, Bhula Bhai is just a face as many fight in the background. From a former judge to a helpless father, this faceless crowd constitutes people from all walks of life. They all understand the value of the judgement and how it can change the entire discourse.Dhulia doesn?t manipulate the court proceedings to earn our sympathy. After all, it?s a film with heavy patriotic fervour, nobody would have minded that, but he sticks to the facts and narrates the story of all the major characters from a neutral perspective. There lies the real beauty of his storytelling as the ambiguity around the lead characters remain till the last moments, and even when it clears you are left with many angles to think about.In one of the scenes, Gurbaksh Dhillon and Shah Nawaz Khan put words to such sentiments. One of them believes that the outcome of the trial gives the British an edge while the other categorically demonstrates how the heavy public outcry can influence their case.This isn?t the most powerful scene in the film though. It?s a conversation between Nehru (Rajesh Khera) and Judge Sehgal (Kanwaljeet Singh) when the latter successfully convinces the former to fight for the three officers inside the court. The dialogues show the director?s delicate understanding of the Indian polity and society.The audience keeps watching everything from a distance when the INA officers disclose their side of the details. It becomes a party to the discussion only when it realises that deciding war crimes is very subjective in nature.Then there are actors like Kenny Basumatary and Mrudula Murali (Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan) who bring a distinct charm to the film. Basumatary?s jovial face while he is weighed against gold makes everything look cheerful.The back and forth in narration hampers the flow, though. Further, the documentary-like feel hampers the drama to reach its zenith, but these are minor issues and can be easily overlooked.What matters is Amit Sadh resurfaces as an able actor after a long time. Kunal Kapoor?s matured take on the life of Shah Nawaz Khan is another plus of Raag Desh. Mohit Marwah also holds his ground and infuses seriousness into the film.There is a strange thing about patriotic films. You know what?s going to happen, but your eyes still get moist when it happens. The same will happen to you as well when Kadam Kadam Badhaaye Jaa will play on the screen. This 137-minute soldier versus traitor story is totally worth your time. Interact with Rohit Vats at Twitter/@nawabjha"

""We have just recorded an unprecedented victory in the biggest state of India. We also have a majority in the Lok Sabha. The biggest take away of this election is that the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased from what it was in May 2014 but at the same time we can see that that there is no Opposition. So we will have to perform the role of the Opposition as well,"" Bharti said while addressing a press conference in Bhopal.""These election results have shown that we have reached a position which the Congress had occupied for a long time after the Bangladesh war of liberation but at that time we were a strong Opposition and provided the glue around which all opposition parties stuck. The Congress, however, is not in that position and is fast losing the little credibility that it had. The party does not have any standing of its own and is trying to latch on to regional players for face saving. This puts an additional responsibility on the BJP,"" Bharti said.On parallels being drawn between her coronation as chief minister in 2003 and that of Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017, Bharti said, ""The saffron colour of robes is not the only similarity that we have. He is like my younger brother and I stay at the Gorakhpur math whenever I go there but the colour of the robes has nothing to do with the performance of any chief minister. Adityanath is an able administrator and he will take strong steps to improve the law and order situation in the state."

The new regulations would play to Indian IT companies' strength because they have been reducing the number of H1-B visas since 2014, Pai added.","Hyderabad, Apr 12 (PTI) The tightening of H1-B work visa rules in the US would be advantageous to Indian IT firms as they would shift more work offshore and also be in a position to improve their billing rate, says industry veteran T V Mohandas Pai. The present business model of Indian IT companies -- offshore-onsite work ratio of 70:30 would now go up to 90:10, the former Chief Financial Officer of Infosys said. ""So, what will happen is they (Indian IT firms) will offshore more work and increase their competitiveness. They will do only ten per cent work onsite, and 90 per cent offshore,"" Pai told PTI. ""It can be done very easily for 70-80 per cent of the business. It will improve their competitiveness and make them better,"" he said. ""The new H1-B regulations are very good for Indian IT, and bad for companies which try to use it for cheap labour.

In video shared on his twitter page, Stalin urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to end the selective use of agencies like IT department, enforcement directorate and CBI for political benefits.He also accused the Centre of using these agencies to feed their political ambitions. In the 2-minute video, Stalin spoke about the hardships faced by farmers in the wake of drought. ""Farmers are committing suicide in Tamil Nadu. The entire Cauvery delta is suffering from drought and the Cauvery management Board has not yet been formed,"" said Stalin. He further spoke about compulsory 'NEET' exams on how it is dismantling the aspirations of students aiming to become medical professionals.

The party is reportedly also in talks with Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan for the campaign ahead of the polls scheduled for April 22.,"After sweeping the civic polls in Maharashtra and almost snatching Mumbai from the Shiv Sena, the BJP has now set its sights on the Delhi municipal corporation. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls are scheduled to take place on April 22, and the BJP, which has been ruling the MCD for over a decade, has planned an aggressive campaign to take on its rivals.Besides the Congress, the BJP will also face challenge from Arvind Kejriwal's the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which is contesting the MCD polls for the first time. A total of 272 seats in North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporation are up for grabs in the election. BJP's CAMPAIGN PLAN FOR MCD POLLSLast week, BJP President Amit Shah appointed a team of five senior leaders to oversee and supervise the poll campaign. The team includes Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Jitendra Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Sanjeev Balyan and Shyam Jaju. ""We are going all out for the MCD polls and have set a very high target for ourselves. Our triumphs in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have given a fresh impetus to our workers and volunteers and to add to that strength, we are bringing in big faces as well,"" a BJP source said.Prominent among the big faces are Amit Shah and Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu who are likely to address a convention of polling booth in-charges at the Ramlila Maidan on March 25. BJP's Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari was quoted by a Hindustan Times report as saying that he will invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a rally in the national capital.The party has also roped in Bhojpuri film star Ravi Kishen to woo the Poorvanchalis (Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh), who form a bulk of voters in Delhi.The Phogat sisters, Geeta and Babita, too will campaign for the BJP in the run up to the MCD polls, while talks with cricketer Shikhar Dhawan are yet to be finalised. BEYOND STAR CAMPAIGNS, WHAT IS BJP PLANNINGThe BJP's rule at the MCD has been tarred by allegations of nepotism and rampant corruption by its councillors. To project a fresh, corruption-free face ahead of the MCD polls, Manoj Tiwari recently announced that the party will not field a single sitting councillor or his/her relative for the upcoming election.The decision took senior BJP councillors in Delhi by surprise but was believed to have the approval of the party's highest leadership. ""Zero-tolerance towards corruption, which is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's style of functioning, has to be our mantra in all party matters, including distribution of tickets,"" Manoj Tiwari said, while brushing off talks of discontentment in the party. ""We are not bothered about the feelings of sitting councillors. We are answerable only to the public, not to the councillors,"" he said.Such sweeping decision in the BJP before the MCD polls comes in the wake of both the Congress and the AAP targeting the BJP-run MCD for corruption. AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly attacked the MCD for having failed to implement Narendra Modi's flagship cleanliness drive on the ground. He called the MCD ""a den of corruption"" which doesn't even ""issue a death certificate without a bribe.""ALSO READ:"

The latest government data show 6,502 people died of respiratory diseases in 2015, making it one of the leading causes of death.Exhaust fumes coupled with smoke from farmers burning paddy stalk in neighbouring states and dust from construction sites formed the thickest smog for two decades to shroud the city after Diwali this year.Read |?Delhi pollution level alarming post Diwali, people complain of ?zero visibility?The Capital is struggling to reduce its air pollution, with measures such as a road rationing formula that allows cars with odd- and even-numbered number plates to ply on alternates days. The government as well as the National Green Tribunal and pollution control boards had banished smoke-belching trucks from the city and sought to scrap all ageing vehicles above 15 years.But these measures are having little effect as people are forced to arrange their own ride because of an inadequate public transport system, which runs mainly on clean fuel such as CNG and electricity.Read |?Capital chaos: Delhi?s traffic has slowed down and doubled time spent on roadsThe ridership and fleet strength of the Delhi Transport Corporation ? the city?s public transporter ? depleted in the past year.

A study by six road design experts found recently that people?s commuting time has doubled in the past six years and traffic speed has halved during peak hours.The average speed has come down from 42kmph to 20kmph. Experts said the city will crawl at 5kmph in 10 years, the average speed at which a human walks.The data released by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also inform that city?s per capita income stood at Rs 280,142 during 2015-16; it has more mobile and fixed line phones; and power consumption has come down to 24,037 million units.Also read | Let?s fight pollution: People vs Delhi?s toxic air"

Sonu Kumari,07-2017,Maha issues draft rules to regularise illegal constructions,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-issues-draft-rules-to-regularise-illegal-constructions/story-mCP8jNTIv1GXtTWtdPeaaP.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"The Maharashtra government on Friday issued draft rules which will reportedly allow regularisation of most illegal constructions built before December 31, 2015, for a ""compounding fee"". A senior official said, ""Within six months of the rules coming into force, planning authorities will have to invite applications from owners and occupiers for consideration of cases for regularisation."""," The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Maharashtra government has set the ball rolling to regularise lakhs of unauthorised buildings and structures in cities across the state, including the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, on the payment of a compounding fee.The state urban development department, which chief minister Devendra Fadnavis heads, on Friday issued draft rules to regularise unauthorised construction till December 31, 2015. The department has invited suggestions and objections on the rules in a month. Lakhs of illegal structures or unauthorised buildings, largely residential ones including those like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli, now stand to benefit from this policy. A senior urban development official said, ?We have formulated the rules mainly keeping residential structures in mind. Within six months of the rules coming into force, planning authorities will have to invite applications from owners and occupiers for consideration of cases for regularisation. The local authority will specify the time and date for the submission of such cases, after which applications will not be considered. The authority will then take a call on the cases as per the rules.?The official said even a case like the controversial Campa Cola compound in Worli stands to benefit if they have purchased the required Floor Space Index (FSI). FSI refers to the ratio of the built-up area to the plot area and indicates the permissible construction limit. The seven buildings in the Campa Cola compound have 35 floors more than what was approved by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), prompting the civic body to send a demolition notice leading to a long protracted legal battle.To pave the way for the regularisation of such structures, the state government passed a bill to amend the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act in the budget session of the legislature in April this year. The move will bring relief to lakhs of citizens in such buildings in places such as Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Navi Mumbai and Pimpri Chinchwad. However, it is also likely to set a precedent and open the decks for further condoning of illegal construction in the future.According to the draft rules, the state?s policy will apply to most cases of unauthorised construction, except for structures in ecologically sensitive zones, Coastal Regulation Zones, land meant for playgrounds or parks, heritage buildings and structurally unsafe buildings, among others.For cases of FSI violations, such as Campa Cola, the draft rules state such construction can be considered for regularisation by procuring premium or fungible FSI, or Transfer of Development Rights, as per applicable norms. Owners or occupants of such structures will have to pay compounding charges at 10 percent of land rate over and above the premium for the extra FSI.Similarly, the draft rules will also allow regularising construction where the structure is taller than the maximum height allowed as per the width of the road it abuts. While local authorities will have to explore the option of road widening in such cases, the state?s draft rules allow them to consider regularisation of the unauthorised construction by levying a compounding fee of 10 percent of the ready reckoner rates.The draft rules also provide for compounding fees for regularisation in case of inadequate setback area, violations in ground coverage, parking, staircase, passage width and misuse of any such free of FSI components. Moreover, building owner or occupants will need to procure the required no-objection certificates from departments such as drainage, water supply, fire, structural stability certificates and so on before regularisation.Once a civic body declares a structure as a compounded structure for regularisation, no further development will be allowed on the plot besides regular maintenance and repairs or redevelopment as per norms.The state government has instructed civic bodies to keep aside all the money collected as compounding fees under these rules for providing public amenities, utilities and services in the respective areas.Read more:Lakhs of illegal structures across Maharashtra to be regularised after penalties"

Dishant Sharma,07-2017,Completing antibiotics course not necessary: Study,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/26/rule-patients-must-finish-antibiotics-course-wrong-study-says?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"A new study has found the rule that patients must complete the course of their prescribed antibiotics is false instead they should stop taking the drugs when they feel better. The study disproves traditional practice of completing courses, which claims that taking too few tablets allows the disease-causing bacteria to mutate and become resistant to the drug.","Telling patients to stop taking antibiotics when they feel better may be preferable to instructing them to finish the course, according to a group of experts who argue that the rule long embedded in the minds of doctors and the public is wrong and should be overturned.Patients have traditionally been told that they must complete courses of antibiotics, the theory being that taking too few tablets will allow the bacteria causing their disease to mutate and become resistant to the drug.But Martin Llewelyn, a professor in infectious diseases at Brighton and Sussex medical school, and colleagues claim that this is not the case. In an analysis in the British Medical Journal, the experts say ?the idea that stopping antibiotic treatment early encourages antibiotic resistance is not supported by evidence, while taking antibiotics for longer than necessary increases the risk of resistance?.There are some diseases where the bug can become resistant if the drugs are not taken for long enough. The most obvious example is tuberculosis, they say. But most of the bacteria that cause people to become ill are found on everybody?s hands in the community, causing no harm, such as E coli and Staphylococcus aureus. People fall ill only when the bug gets into the bloodstream or the gut. The longer such bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the more likely it is that resistance will develop.The experts say there has been too little research into the ideal length of a course of antibiotics, which also varies from one individual to the next, depending in part on what antibiotics they have taken in the past.In hospital, patients can be tested to work out when to stop the drugs. ?Outside hospital, where repeated testing may not be feasible, patients might be best advised to stop treatment when they feel better,? they say. That, they add, is in direct contravention of World Health Organisation advice.Other experts in infectious diseases backed the group. ?I have always thought it to be illogical to say that stopping antibiotic treatment early promotes the emergence of drug-resistant organisms,? said Peter Openshaw, president of the British Society for Immunology. ?This brief but authoritative review supports the idea that antibiotics may be used more sparingly, pointing out that the evidence for a long duration of therapy is, at best, tenuous. Far from being irresponsible, shortening the duration of a course of antibiotics might make antibiotic resistance less likely.?Alison Holmes, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said a great British authority, Prof Harold Lambert, had made the same point in a Lancet article entitled ?Don?t keep taking the tablets? as early as 1999. ?It remains astonishing that apart from some specific infections and conditions, we still do not know more about the optimum duration of courses or indeed doses in many conditions, yet this dogma has been pervasive and persistent.?Jodi Lindsay, a professor of microbial pathogenesis at St George?s, University of London, said it was sensible advice. ?The evidence for ?completing the course? is poor, and the length of the course of antibiotics has been estimated based on a fear of under-treating rather than any studies,? she said. ?The evidence for shorter courses of antibiotics being equal to longer courses, in terms of cure or outcome, is generally good, although more studies would help and there are a few exceptions when longer courses are better ? for example, TB.?But the Royal College of GPs expressed concerns. ?Recommended courses of antibiotics are not random,? said its chair, Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard. ?They are tailored to individual conditions and in many cases, courses are quite short ? for urinary tract infections, for example, three days is often enough to cure the infection. ?We are concerned about the concept of patients stopping taking their medication midway through a course once they ?feel better?, because improvement in symptoms does not necessarily mean the infection has been completely eradicated. It?s important that patients have clear messages and the mantra to always take the full course of antibiotics is well known. Changing this will simply confuse people.?England?s chief medical officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said: ?The message to the public remains the same: people should always follow the advice of healthcare professionals. To update policies, we need further research to inform them.?[The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] is currently developing guidance for managing common infections, which will look at all available evidence on appropriate prescribing of antibiotics.?The Department of Health will continue to review the evidence on prescribing and drug-resistant infections, as we aim to continue the great progress we have made at home and abroad on this issue.?"

Situated over the Brahmaputra river at an aerial distance of around 100 km from the Chinese border, the bridge can withstand the weight of a 60-tonne battle tank. The bridge's construction began in 2011 at a cost of ?950 crore.","India's longest river bridge, capable of withstanding the weight of a 60-tonne battle tank, will be inaugurated in Assam close to the border with China on May 26 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.With the inauguration of the 9.15-km-long Dhola-Sadiya bridge over the Brahmaputra river, the prime minister will kick start the celebrations of the NDA government's three years in office from this eastern-most part of Assam.The bridge is seen as an attempt by India to shore up its defence requirements along the Sino-Indian border particularly in the Northeast besides providing easy access to the people of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam with air and rail connectivity.It is 3.55 km longer than the Bandra-Worli sea link in Mumbai, making it the longest bridge in India.""The prime minister will dedicate the strategically important bridge to the nation on May 26. It will bolster the road connectivity in the Northeast as the bridge will be used by people of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh besides defence forces extensively,"" Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told PTI.BRIDGE CAN WITHSTAND MOVEMENT OF MILITARY TANKSThe construction of the bridge began in 2011 at a project cost of Rs 950 crore. The design is such that the bridge can withstand the movement of military tanks.""Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have huge strategic value to the country. Since the bridge is located close to our border with China, it will help quick movement of military troops and artillery in times of conflict,"" Sonowal said.The bridge is located 540-km away from Assam capital Dispur and 300 km away from Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar. The aerial distance to the Chinese border is less than 100 km.After Kaliabhomora bridge near Tezpur, there is no bridge over the Brahmaputra for the next 375 km upstream till Dhola, where the new bridge is constructed. Currently, all the transport between the two banks of the river are being carried out through water only.BRIDGE TO CUT DOWN TRAVEL TIMEThe bridge, when opened for the public, will cut down the travel time between Assam and Arunachal Pradesh by as much as four hours.As there is no civilian airport in Arunachal Pradesh, this bridge will help people of the state to reach the nearest rail head in Tinsukia and the airport in Dibrugarh easily.Sonowal said the delayed works of the bridge was expedited after Modi assumed the charge in 2014. The bridge was originally scheduled to open in 2015.The Bharatiya Janata Party government in Assam will complete one year in office on May 24.The bridge is one of the key projects of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in the Northeast and is built in public-private partnership with a construction company.

The 8-km extension will pass through the Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) on the eastern waterfront. Officials haven?t planned how much of the extension will be elevated and how much of it will be underground.

MbPT is currently carrying out a study on how to commercially exploit the its 550-hectare land parcel. They have envisaged to revamp the eastern waterfront into a hub of recreation and entertainment. ?MbPT has conveyed to the MMRDA that it would like an underground line, but the final decision will be taken once the report is out,? said a senior official.Officials added MbPT will share the project cost as the extension would help them get footfalls when port trust land is developed commercially.

The victim was spotted bleeding by locals who rushed him to a nearby hospital. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has ordered a probe into the matter.,"A 19-year-old German national, who is on his second visit to India, was stabbed and robbed by two men near Kashmere Gate in north Delhi on Friday, police said on Saturday.According to police, Benjamin Scholt was returning from Chandni Chowk in a rickshaw on Friday night when he was attacked at around 11pm.?On way to Kashmere Gate from Chandni Chowk in a rickshaw, the driver offered a lift to another (person). The two men stabbed him with a blade or a similar sharp object on his face and robbed him of his phone and wallet,? said an officer.A bleeding Scholt tried fleeing towards the Geeta Colony flyover and was spotted by locals who rushed him to a nearby hospital.

Starc was given a send-off by Ashwin during the second Test, with Ashwin tapping his forehead. It was in reply to Starc taunting Abhinav Mukund in the similar manner earlier.","The ongoing four-Test series between India and Australia has been acrimonious with players from both sides trading verbal blows but Australian pacer Mitchell Starc's latest comments could send relations between the two teams spiralling down further. (Johnson, Warne take a dig at Virat Kohli's Team India after Ranchi draw)Also watch:Cheteshwar Pujara is definitely India's wall: Michael Clarke to India TodayThe injury-prone Starc had to return home after Australia were crushed in Bengaluru as India drew level following a heavy defeat in Pune. But the left-arm pacer, far from the maddening action in India, did not want to miss out on the banter and sledging that has dominated the series and took a nasty dig at star India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, promising to hit him on the head when he next visited Australia. (Inability to bowl us out will be hurting India, says Steven Smith)""I look forward to bowling to Ashwin in Australia. (I might) take his advice and hit him on the badge,"" Starc was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. (Steve Smith says Peter Handscomb, Shaun Marsh repaid his faith)Starc's insensitive comments come on the back of a cheeky response by Ashwin, who had rubbed his forehead with a forefinger after dismissing the Aussie all-rounder during the visitors' failed run-chase at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. (Virat Kohli alleges Australia of disrespecting team physio Patrick Farhart)As Australia stuttered and stumbled in their 188-run chase on a tricky Bengaluru pitch in the second Test, Ashwin, who had rocked the visitors with three wickets before tea, snuffed out the dangerous Starc. As part of the celebrations, Ashwin rubbed his forehead with his index finger. (Sunil Gavaskar says Virat Kohli missed a trick in Ranchi)For those of you wondering why Ashwin did that, here's a recap of what happened in India's second innings. Starc was bowling a fiery spell on Sunday and Abhinav Mukund was in the firing line. As it happened, a top-edge off his bat flew over his head for a six. It was then that Starc rubbed his forehead with his index finger.Ashwin was clearly standing up for a teammate and added insult to Starc's injury after a crucial blow. While India's players have been matured enough to leave the onfield rivalry behind, Starc's latest comments could pave the way for another controversy. In 2014, Australian batsman Phil Hughes was killed after being hit on the head by a bouncer. Ever since, there have been serious concerns after batsmen have copped blows on their headgear. Starc, in retrospection, might be embarrassed with his words. Australia, the pioneers of mental disintegration, have been clearly rattled by India's onslaught over the last two decades. In 2014, the likes of David Warner and Steve Smith were involved in some heated moments with Indian cricketers before Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma responded in kind. "

Vani Vivek,04-2017,Google's discrimination against women quite extreme: US govt,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/07/google-pay-disparities-women-labor-department-lawsuit?CMP=share_btn_tw ,"Accusing technology major Google of underpaying women, the US Department of Labor said that ""discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme"". The government department also alleged that Google violated employment laws in relation to salaries for its female employees. Earlier this month, Google had claimed to have closed the gender pay gap globally.","Google has discriminated against its female employees, according to the US Department of Labor (DoL), which said it had evidence of ?systemic compensation disparities?.As part of an ongoing DoL investigation, the government has collected information that suggests the internet search giant is violating federal employment laws with its salaries for women, agency officials said. ?We found systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,? Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified in court in San Francisco on Friday.Reached for comment Friday afternoon, Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the DoL, said: ?The investigation is not complete, but at this point the department has received compelling evidence of very significant discrimination against women in the most common positions at Google headquarters.?Herold added: ?The government?s analysis at this point indicates that discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry.?Google strongly denied the accusations of inequities, claiming it did not have a gender pay gap.The explosive allegation against one of the largest and most powerful companies in Silicon Valley comes at a time when the male-dominated tech industry is facing increased scrutiny over gender discrimination, pay disparities and sexual harassment. The allegations emerged at a hearing in federal court as part of a lawsuit the DoL filed against Google in January, seeking to compel the company to provide salary data and documents to the government.Google is a federal contractor, which means it is required to allow the DoL to inspect and copy records and information about its its compliance with equal opportunity laws. Last year, the department?s office of federal contract compliance programs requested job and salary history for Google employees, along with names and contact information, as part of the compliance review.Google, however, repeatedly refused to hand over the data, which was a violation of its contractual obligations with the federal government, according to the DoL?s lawsuit. After the suit was originally filed, a company spokesperson claimed that Google had provided ?hundreds of thousands of records? to the government and that the requests outlined in the complaint were ?overbroad?, revealed confidential information, or violated employees? privacy. Labor officials detailed the government?s discrimination claims against Google at the Friday hearing while making the case for why the company should be forced to comply with the DoL?s requests for documents. Wipper said the department found pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and said officials needed earlier compensation data to evaluate the root of the problem and needed to be able to confidentially interview employees. ?We want to understand what?s causing the disparity,? she said. Lisa Barnett Sween, one of Google?s attorneys, testified in opening remarks that the DoL?s request constituted a ?fishing expedition that has absolutely no relevance to the compliance review?. She said the request was an unconstitutional violation of the company?s fourth amendment right to protection from unreasonable searches.Marc Pilotin, a DoL attorney, said: ?For some reason or another, Google wants to hide the pay-related information.?In a statement to the Guardian, Google said: ?We vehemently disagree with [Wipper?s] claim. Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap. Other than making an unfounded statement which we heard for the first time in court, the DoL hasn?t provided any data, or shared its methodology.?The company has recently claimed that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and provides equal pay across races in the US. Herold told the Guardian that the department ?seeks additional information to ensure the accuracy of the department?s findings, because if the findings are confirmed, this is a troubling situation?.Google is not the first tech company to face legal action from the labor department over employment practices. In September, the DoL filed a lawsuit against Palantir, the Palo Alto data analytics company, alleging it systematically discriminated against Asian job applicants in its hiring process. Palantir has argued that the DoL?s analysis was flawed and the company has denied the accusations.In January, the department sued Oracle, another large tech company, claiming it paid white men more than others, leading to pay discrimination against women and black and Asian employees. Oracle claimed the case was ?politically motivated? and said its employment decisions were based on merit and experience.In recent months, there has been uncertainty about the future of these kinds of aggressive DoL enforcement efforts under Donald Trump. The president has rolled back Obama-era protections for female workers, and some DoL staffers have raised concerns that the new administration will not embrace the agency?s core mission of supporting workers? rights. An Oracle executive also joined Trump?s transition team, and the president?s close adviser Peter Thiel co-founded Palantir. In the Google case, the labor department?s lawyers have asked the court to cancel all of the company?s federal contracts and block any future business with the government if it continues to refuse to comply with the audit.Google began releasing diversity statistics in 2014 and reported last year that women made up 31% of its overall workforce and that only 2% of workers were black and 3% Latino. White employees accounted for 59% of the US workforce and Asians made up 32%.Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"

Mansha Mahajan,05-2017,Tonic water firm Founder earns ?602 crore on selling shares,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/25/fever-tree-founder-shares-charles-rolls-tonic?CMP=twt_gu ,"Charles Rolls, the Co-founder of upmarket tonic water maker Fever-Tree, sold a stake of around 4% in the company for Â£73 million (around ?602 crore). Rolls cashed in the shares that have risen over 50% this year alone and are currently up 924% since its IPO in late 2014. After the sale, Rolls still owns around 11.2% of the company.","Fever-Tree, the upmarket tonic water maker, suffered the rarest of hiccups in its meteoric rise after co-founder Charles Rolls cashed in Â£73m of shares.The sale left the company?s stock down 2% at Â£17.12 on Thursday ? but that is still nearly 13 times its Â£1.34 price tag when it floated less than three years ago.Demand for the shares from City investors was so great that Rolls offloaded 4.5m shares, a 3.9% stake, having initially planned to release 2.5m.He retains an 11.2% holding worth Â£222m, and the company is valued at nearly Â£2bn.That means Fever-Tree is worth more than Britvic, its 170-year old rival, more than the UK arm of Domino?s Pizza, and about three times as much as the Debenhams store chain.That is astonishing for a business with sales of just Â£100m and only 46 full-time staff that has done little more than concoct a fancy mixer for gin. But it is testament to the super-speed growth the company has delivered since Rolls and co-founder Tim Warrillow launched it in 2005.From a standing start, the duo became millionaires within a decade, selling Â£25m of stock between them when they floated the company on the AIM market in 2014. Rolls has cashed out to the tune of Â£100m, because he also sold a Â£12m tranche of shares last year.He owes not just his fortune but apparently his life to tonic water ? or at least to its key medicinal ingredient, quinine. He once contracted malaria during a trip to Africa and has credited the chemical, obtained from the bark of the cinchona tree referenced in the company?s name, with saving his life.Though the company started out with tonic water, it has expanded to include variants on the drink, as well as Sicilian lemonade and ginger ale.It has managed to stand out from the crowd by consciously embracing luxury status, making much of the exotic origin of its ingredients and the great expense of getting them into your glass.Its ginger comes from Ivory Coast and Nigeria, its lemons from Sicily, and Warrillow once braved checkpoints manned by militiamen to source quinine from a remote part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.These are the credentials that have ensured no luxury hotel or Michelin-starred restaurant is without a supply of Fever-Tree in its mixer cabinet.Indeed, one of the company?s early customers was world-renowned chef Ferran AdriÃ , who made its tonic a firm fixture in his restaurant El Bulli, rated by many gastronomes as the world?s best and quirkiest restaurant before it served up its last liquid olive in 2011.Posh tonic has also benefited from a serendipitous resurgence in gin, increasingly seen as a sophisticated spirit worth splashing out on.Gin menus are a common feature of bars in countries where the spirit is particularly popular such as the UK, Spain and US. And premium gins demand to be mixed with premium tonics.Fever-Tree has ridden the crest of this alcoholic wave like no other company, reporting pre-tax profits last year that more than doubled to Â£34.3m on sales of Â£102m.This month, the company announced that its 2017 results would comfortably exceed City forecasts, indicating that the Fever-Tree star is still very much in the ascendancy.Rolls, a former management consultant who revived the Plymouth Gin brand, and Warrilow, a former ad man, teamed up in an attempt to challenge the domination by Schweppes of the mixers market.Rolls had noticed that the world?s finest gins were mixed with the same mass-produced tonic. ?There?s no point having a good gin if the tonic isn?t right,? he said, pointing out that tonic makes up the lion?s share of a G&T, at least if it is made right.This year, Rolls ended his day-to-day involvement in the company, moving from executive deputy chairman to a non-executive position.That might explain why he feels able to start cashing in, a decision that might have given investors pause for thought if he were still engaged in building the business.And with an extra Â£73m in the bank, Rolls has little reason to wait until the sun is past the yard-arm for his first G&T of the day."

Nawazuddin tweeted on July 17 while talking about the discrimination he has faced in the Hindi film industry over appearance.After that a few Bollywood celebrities have extended their support to Nawazuddin and said that not only the film industry, but racism happens all over India.Bollywood actors Tiger Shroff, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nidhhi Agerwal during an exclusive interview with HT City-Hindustan Times for the promotion of a movie Munna Michael.
							(Hindustan Times)
						Here?s what these celebs have to say:Tapsee Pannu: We are a colour-obsessed nation selling fairness creams in high volumes. Our matrimonial columns till date have a mention of skin colour. So let?s not target only the film industry.Nandita Das: I am sure it is no surprise to anyone that Nawazuddin?s skin colour would have impeded his career. All around us the images of women and now increasingly of men, are those with light skin. Be it films, television, magazines, hoardings, ads... Everywhere we have ?fair? people, in a country that is largely dark! Every skin care product has a skin lightening element. Dark skinned people are often  made to feel inadequate... right from their childhood. I can see the challenges that Nawazuddin must have faced in his career. After he has been around for over 10 years, it is his sheer talent and perseverance that has made him overcome this prejudice.Anshuman Jha: ?I am offered unconventional roles. But I personally haven?t faced any racism in this industry. But this industry is all about how good you look, and therefore discrimination is bound to exist. In the West, the black American actor Jamie Foxx can be paired opposite any leading lady. Here the criterion for casting is how compatible he or she looks with the other actor instead of performing abilities.Tannishtha Chatterjee: ?I think the film industry is not so colour biased. Such colour biases exist more in the advertising industry. Our society at large still suffers from these prejudices. Artistes and art need to speak up against societal prejudice. I?ve never endorsed fairness creams. I?ve never allowed anyone to make me look fair on screen. Pankaj Tripathi: Racism is part of the Indian mindset. We can?t escape it. However the very fact that Nawazuddin?s comment on racism has triggered off a reaction proves that the mindset is changing.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

The police added that one accused was killed in an encounter with security forces earlier this month. Reportedly, the police have also recovered an iron rod used to hit Pandith.","No one knew who Jammu and Kashmir police officer Mohammad Ayub Pandith was on the night he was stripped and lynched in Srinagar last month and his identity became clear only the next morning, the Valley?s top police officer said on Monday.Inspector general of police (Kashmir range) Muneer Khan told reporters that 20 people were arrested for the crime on June 23, when thousands had gathered for night-long congregational prayers on Islam?s holiest night of Shab-e-Qadr. The lynching was widely condemned across ideological leanings in the Valley and across the country.Describing the events of the night, Khan said 57-year-old Pandith, who was in plainclothes, was confronted by four men coming out of Jamia Masjid allegedly shouting slogans in support of Zakir Musa, a top militant who has called for Islamic rule in Kashmir. The men allegedly were at the mosque to welcome separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.?Four of the miscreants saw the deputy SP checking the deployment -- he was on duty for access control. Then these four guys called him and started questioning him and asked for his I-card and he refused to give it. That is how the thing started. They started heckling, the number of miscreants swelled and rest is history,? Khan said.Ayub Pandith was killed by a mob outside a mosque in Srinagar.Khan also ruled out any possibility of dereliction of duty by the police in the case and said apart from the darkness and the noise, no one knew of Pandith?s identity.?The deputy SP was there to ensure the safety and security of all devotees who had come to pray at Jamia Masjid on Shab-e-Qadr night, including the Mirwaiz,? he said. ?The body was defaced and disfigured, and his clothes were torn.? Khan also praised the cooperation of common people in the investigation.Khan said one of the accused was Sajad Gilkar, who went underground after the incident and was killed in an encounter with security forces in Budgam on July 12. Prior to the lynching, Gilkar was, according to the police, booked under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) thrice and wanted in stone-pelting and stabbing cases. The officer said the investigation would be completed within stipulated time. ?The investigation of the case is going on in absolutely right manner, expeditiously and effectively. Some more arrests are expected and some more evidence is to be collected.? Khan added that the police initially arrested three suspects and their questioning led to further arrests and the recovery of crucial pieces of evidence such as the iron rod allegedly used to hit Pandith, his pistol - from which he had fired in self-defence after being heckled by the mob - as well as his cell phone that was taken away by the attackers.The three men, who were injured below the waist after Pandith fired in self-defence, have also been arrested as they allegedly were the ones who initially started heckling the police official, Khan said."

Sumedha Sehra,07-2017,"77 votes in Prez polls invalid due to circles, dots, commas",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dots-and-commas-among-reasons-for-rejection-of-votes-in-presidential-poll/story-x5haIXomo5zr5QtJuAKiWK.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"As many as 77 votes were declared invalid in the Presidential elections, because of invalid symbols like commas, dots, and circles, according to the people involved in counting. The number '1' with a '.' was the most common mistake, while the ""1"" (one in inverted commas) came second. One voter wrote '1' on Meira Kumar's name instead of the box.","Dots and inverted commas have come to confound political parties, who are seeking to identify rebels during the 2017 presidential poll. These led to the rejection of votes by 21 MPs and 56 MLAs, triggering much curiosity and concern among parties.These 77 votes, with a value of 20,942, might be inconsequential to the outcome: NDA candidate Ram Nath Kovind romped home with a margin of 3.67 lakh (in terms of value of votes). But there is no full stop in politics, as then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi said after the UPA?s victory in 2009.Both the NDA and the opposition camps are anxious to know how many of the 77 invalid votes were a result of inadvertent errors and how many were by design. Over a hundred legislators were estimated to have cross-voted in valid votes.Those involved in the counting of votes on July 20 told HT that invalid ones were due to dots, inverted commas, circles and slants that electors erroneously used on their ballot papers. They were supposed to express their first preference simply with a numeral 1 ? second preference was unnecessary in a bipolar contest?in the box against the name of Kovind or Meira Kumar, the opposition parties? nominee.A Congress MLA from Haryana wrote 1. (numeral with a period-mark) rendering his vote invalid. Most of the 77 legislators made the same mistake, said those involved in counting.The second most common error was ?1?. Some put a circle around the numeric. The BJP got one vote invalidated because the 1 was slanted ?by about 30 to 40 degrees? and not perpendicular; the Congress got the same opportunity later. One of the MLAs wrote 1 over Meira Kumar?s name.Given that legislators were clearly informed about the dos and don?ts, such errors were unexpected. Many of them could be inadvertent and a result of sheer habit but the rules set by the poll watchdog were not to be bent.Senior BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab recalled one such instance in 2012 presidential poll in which he was the counting agent for PA Sangma. A Congress MLA from Odisha decided to go by his conscience?permitted in presidential polls where there is no party whip ? and voted for Sangma. He used Oriya numeral P and not E for 1. Although both are used for 1, his vote was rejected after the Congress objected to it.The list of possible errors is long. According to Anoop Mishra, secretary general of the Lok Sabha and the Returning Officer for the presidential poll, any of these can lead a vote invalid: Writing the same preference number outside both candidate?s names, putting a tick mark, or writing outside the box. ?Votes can also be declared invalid if there are any other marks, which are not required and which can later identify the voter. These can even be a dot, a line or even a wrong-coloured ink,? he told HT.Deepender Singh Hooda, counting agent for Meira Kumar, maintained that ?broadly, votes for both sides got cancelled? due to errors, but the BJP seemed better prepared. Senior BJP leader Bhupendra Yadav, counting agent for Kovind, said that a day before the poling, his party had made a presentation to its legislators on voting rules.?It?s possible that some members themselves might have got their votes rejected, but there could also be inadvertent errors. The Election Commission should think of a better way to ensure that votes are not rejected,? said Hooda."

All voters were given special serial-numbered pens with violet ink before entering the polling station, and their personal pens were collected. MPs had green-coloured ballot papers and MLAs pink-coloured ones.","MPs and MLAs who vote to elect the next President on Monday have been barred from carrying their personal pens inside the voting chamber and will have to mark their ballot with a specially-designed marker, the Election Commission said on Sunday.Following the ink controversy in the Rajya Sabha polls in Haryana last year, the Election Commission has decided to use special pens for the electors to mark their votes in the presidential and vice presidential polls.Specially serial-numbered pens with violet ink have been supplied by the Election Commission to ensure that only the writing instrument issued by it is used by voters to mark their votes.?Before entering the voting chamber, a polling staff will collect personal pens from the voters and hand over the special pen to mark their vote on the ballot paper.?When the member comes out of the voting chamber, the special pen will be taken back and the polling staff will return the personal pen,? a Commission spokesperson explained the new rule.While announcing the schedule of the election, the poll panel had made it clear that use of any other pen could lead to invalidation of the vote at the time of counting under the Presidential and Vice Presidential Elections Rules, 1974.These special pens have been procured from Mysore paints and varnish Ltd which supplies indelible ink to the EC.In another first, the poll watchdog has also prepared special posters carrying dos and don?ts for the voters. It asks them to use only EC-issued pen and warns that no whip or directive can be issued to party members to vote in favour of any candidate. Since it is a secret ballot, the voters should not disclose whom they have voted for.Green-coloured ballot papers will be there for members of Parliament and pink for MLAs who vote in the election.The value of an MLA?s vote depends on the population of the state he or she represents. But the value of the vote of an MP does not vary -- it is 708.Hence, the different colour of ballot papers will help the returning officer count the votes based on the value. The total value of the electoral college is 10,98,903.The ballot boxes will be brought to Delhi for counting on July 20.The electoral college, which elects the President through the system of proportional representation, comprises elected MPs and members of state legislative assemblies -- a total of 4,896 voters including 4,120 MLAs and 776 elected MPs.While 233 are elected members of the Rajya Sabha, 543 are from the Lok Sabha.A total of 32 polling stations -- one in Parliament House and one each in the state legislative assemblies, have been set up.33 observers have been appointed by the EC to oversee the conduct of election. While two observers will be present in the Parliament House, one each will be deployed in the respective state assemblies.NDA nominee Ram Nath Kovind is pitted against opposition candidate Meira Kumar in presidential poll."

""There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask,"" he said. ""I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere,"" he added.","Thanjavur, Jan 16 (PTI) M Natarajan, husband of AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala, tonight accused ""some sections"" in the BJP of trying to split the AIADMK and get the state government dismissed. ""They are trying to break the AIADMK and dismiss our government. They are trying to besmirch our government. There are also attempts to saffronise Tamil Nadu but they will not succeed. I will tour the entire state and tear their mask,"" he said. ""We will not allow such conspiracies to succeed...I will face the challenge squarely...I am willing to come anywhere single-handedly, to Gujarat, to UP, anywhere,"" he said while addressing the valedictory session of the three-day Thamizhar Kalai Ilakkiya Pongal Thiruvizha (Tamil art and literary Pongal festival) here. The remarks of Natarajan are significant because he is said to wield considerable influence in the AIADMK, particularly after the demise of J Jayalalithaa, and his allegation against the BJP comes against the souring relations between the two parties. Later when asked by reporters about the attempts to divide the party and dismiss the government, Natarajan said definitely attempts were on at the behest of S Gurumurthy, the RSS ideologue. Significantly, Gurumurthy, who has taken over as Editor of Thuglaq magazine after the demise of founder-editor Cho S Ramaswamy, had made veiled remarks at the annual readers interaction on Saturday in Chennai that while one party was already under the control of a family (apparent reference to DMK), another party was going into the control of a family (AIADMK). Natarajan dared Gurumurthy to come out ""in the open"" and oppose them and ""not hide behind"". He also questioned the security being given to Gurumurthy who held no position in the government. He said while they support Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there were others who were creating problem for the AIADMK. Natarajan said when powerful forces were acting against Jayalalithaa after MGRs death, it was he and his family who had protected her like a shield. ""There were just four or five of us who protected her...for 36 years since then, my wife Sasikala was bearing her on her shoulders,"" Natarajan said delving on the hard sacrifices that he and his family had made to protect Jayalalithaa and thereby preserve the AIADMK from the designs of the rival DMK. He said unnecessary controversies and questions were being raised over Jayalalithaas treatment in the hospital. Her entire treatment has been recorded. She was with a clear mind while in the hospital, he claimed. Complimenting Chief Minister O Panneerselvam of giving able administration, Natarajan said it was his personal opinion that he should continue as CM. "

The bank said identifying a user's unique voiceprint will take 15 seconds, down from an average 45 seconds it takes currently. The authentication will be completed automatically while the customers speak to the bank official.","New Delhi, Jan 10 (PTI)Foreign lender Citi India today launched voice biometrics authentication that would replace the current practice of interactive voice response (IVR) for its customers. The new technology allows clients to use their voiceprints for authentication rather than having to remember multiple PINs or respond to questions used for verifying their identities, Citi South Asia Head (Operations & Technology) Anand Chopra said. The voice biometrics authentication capability uses voiceprint, similar to fingerprint, which is unique for each person. The new authentication solution is fast, secure and convenient as verification is completed automatically within 15 seconds while clients speak to the (bank) official when they call CitiPhone Banking, the 24-hour hotline service. Earlier, on an average, it took 45 seconds for a customer to verify his/her details. ""This technology will definitely add to customer convenience by saving around 30 seconds/per call, on verifying their identity. This will create opportunities for our Citiphone banking officers to engage with our customers in a holistic manner and provide more value-added services to them,"" he said. On an average, CitiPhone in India receives 12.5 million calls annually. When clients call CitiPhone Banking, they can choose to enroll for this service by having their voice recorded to generate their unique voiceprint. Each voiceprint will be uniquely tagged and cannot be emulated or reused once stored. ""Voice biometrics authentication coupled with our already launched e-chat and virtual assistant feature, will transform the way we service the Citi customers in India. We anticipate a very high uptake for the use of voice biometrics authentication amongst our customers,"" Chopra said. Clients can enroll for the voice biometrics authentication by calling CitiPhone Banking. Upon clients agreement, a recording will be made of their voice while speaking with a CitiPhone officer. "

Congress can remove presidents if enough lawmakers vote saying they committed crimes including treason and bribery.,"A Democratic congressman has become the first US lawmaker to formally file an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump, but the effort is likely to stall in the Republican-controlled Congress.Democrat Brad Sherman of California followed through on a threat he made last month to seek to remove the president from office, filing a four-page resolution aimed at ?impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanours?.Sherman in a statement said Trump?s apparent effort to quash a probe into his campaign?s ties to Russia and an investigation of a senior aide amounted to obstruction of justice.?Recent disclosures by Donald Trump Jr indicate that Trump?s campaign was eager to receive assistance from Russia,? Sherman said. ?It now seems likely that the president had something to hide when he tried to curtail the investigation of (now-fired) national security adviser Michael Flynn and the wider Russian probe,? he added. ?I believe his conversations with, and subsequent firing of, FBI director James Comey constitute obstruction of justice.?The White House reacted with disdain when a reporter asked for reaction to Sherman?s move.?I think that is utterly and completely ridiculous and a political game at its worst,? White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said.Sherman said his effort used language similar to that of the first article of impeachment issued against Richard Nixon, which passed the House Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974. Nixon resigned from office 13 days later.So far a single lawmaker, Democrat Al Green, has signed on to the resolution.While a number of Republicans have rebuked Trump or expressed concern for various stumbles, there is no signal from either the House of Representatives or the Senate that their Republican leaders are prepared to begin impeachment proceedings."

Saloni Tandon,06-2017,"1200 laws repealed in last 3 yrs, 1301 in 65 yrs before that",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-law-ministry-ravi-shankar-prasad/1/984539.html ,"The Narendra Modi-led NDA government has repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in its three years in power, compared to 1,301 laws being removed in the 65 years prior to that. The laws include one which states that an inspector in Andhra Pradesh must have well-brushed teeth. Another 200-year-old repealed law allowed the British monarch to review decisions of all Indian courts.","Under the Indian Motor Vehicles Act 1914, an inspector in Andhra Pradesh must have well-brushed teeth, and will be disqualified if he has a pigeon chest, knock knees, flatfeet and hammer toes.This is one among a tangle of bizarre, archaic laws, which survived for years like a relic in a museum but with no relevance in modern India.Many of these rules put up obstacles to running smooth administration and ease to do business. The Narendra Modi government had made it clear at its inception that it was time for these dinosaurs to go extinct.Among the myriad laws in India, there are those that made strange demands. A century-old one said the toll tax for boats ferrying passengers across the river Ganga cannot be more than two annas - a denomination not in use any more.According to another one, policemen in some states have to ensure that air-dropped pamphlets do not fall in their areas. This was aimed to foil the propaganda campaign during World War II.A 200-year-old law allowed the British monarch to review decisions of all Indian courts. But these Acts are now history.OLD LAWS SWIFTLY SCRAPPED The Modi government is creating a record of sorts in scrapping these old, redundant and archaic laws from statute books.While successive governments could remove just 1,301 obsolete laws which came in the way of smooth administration and economic growth in 65 years, the present central government has managed to weed out as many as 1,200 Acts in just three years. As many as 1,824 more obsolete central Acts have been identified for repeal.The Opposition-dominated Upper House too played its part when it passed the bills concerning repeal of 1,159 central laws. The Rajya Sabha passed four such bills.""The Modi government is determined to relegate several archaic Acts to history. Laws need to be consonant with the times. 1,200 redundant Acts have been scrapped. 1,824 more have been identified for repeal,"" said law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.Before this, under the Indian Aircraft Act, 1934, kites were also aircraft and you needed to obtain a permit as required for an aeroplane.Under the Indian Treasure Trove Act, 1878 you could have been jailed if you found anything worth more than Rs 10 and did not report it to a revenue officer. POLL PROMISEDuring the 2014 election campaign, Modi promised that if the BJP came to power, for every law passed, his government would repeal 10 obsolete ones.Laws on licence to kill and capture of wild elephants in certain circumstances, segregation and medical treatment of lepers, regulating the grant of titles to qualified persons in western medical science and prohibition of pledging of labour of children (child slavery) are among those abolished.Also have been dumped some archaic rules regulating recruitment of foreigners during pre-Independence period, agreement with Pakistan on exchange of prisoners, continuation of use of courts in Bengal, Assam and Punjab for those who migrated to Pakistan and power to regulate prices of newspapers. There were many more laws in the statute books which had been of no use as provisions of most of the old Acts had already been incorporated in new legislation.But time is running out for such laws. The government had formed a committee headed by R Ramanujam, secretary to the prime minister's office, to re-examine all Acts recommended to be repealed by the earlier committee on Review of Administrative Laws set up by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1998.After taking the help of the Law Commission, the panel is submitting periodic reports.

Farmers in Madhya Pradesh also joined in, protesting the killing of five farmers in police firing in Mandsaur recently during an agitation. Farmers in UP called the government's loan waiver an eyewash, saying nobody benefited from it.","While PM Narendra Modi led the country in celebrating the International Yoga Day, farmers in a few states protested by performing shavasana (corpse pose) to highlight the agrarian crisis.In Madhya Pradesh, farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh headed by Shivkumar Sharma demonstrated their protest by performing the 'shavasana', since their demands for loan waiver and better prices for the agriculture produce are still not met. They demanded action against the administrative and police officials responsible for the firing in Mandsaur which killed five farmers and left scores injured.Recently, on June 15, a large gathering of farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh converged at Jantar Mantar in the national capital to stage protest against their poor condition. The Kisan Mahapanchayat, organised by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), also protested today, organising a 'Yoga on Highways' session to protest alleged anti-farmer policies of the Modi government. In Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, hundreds of farmers belonging to BKU laid on the highway performing 'shavasan', bringing the traffic on NH-28 to a standstill. However, they allowed ambulances and students to pass through.Harinam Singh Verma, a BKU leader said, ""The loan waiver of Yogi was a mere eyewash and not a single farmer has benefited out of it. Imagine, we have to sell our milk at 25 Rs/litre, whereas bottled waters are sold at rs 50 to 60 of some brands.""Mukesh Singh, another leader demanded higher support price for the produce. He lamented that, ""The central government has failed to live up to its promises and the farmers are left to fend for themselves. We are agitated by what happened in Mandsaur."" The farmers however cleared the highway for traffic after the token protest. Earlier, they had plans to stage the protest till 12.00 noon.According to the BKU President Naresh Tikait, while Prime Minister Modi performs Yoga at Lucknow Stadium; farmers all over the country will block highways between 9 am to 12 noon as a mark of protest. The Opposition has slammed the Centre for not managing the farmer crisis efficiently. Congress and other opposition parties criticised the BJP for making false promises of loan waivers. On June 19, Punjab became the third state this year after UP and Maharashtra to announce a waiver on crop loans.Also Read:International Yoga Day: Yoga is about an inexpensive health assurance, says PM ModiInternational Yoga Day: Tight security at Delhi's Connaught Place "

Urging the nations to combat terrorism, India further asked them to back its efforts for the adoption of a comprehensive convention on terrorism at the UN.","Minister of State for External Affairs Gen (retd)VK Singh today delivered a strong message on combatting terrorism at the first summit of BRICS foreign ministers in Beijing, urging countries ""to not differentiate"" between ""good and bad terrorists"".India hopes the bloc of emerging countries will take a strong and unified stand on terrorism. Gen Singh's message in Beijing took on added salience, considering that the Chinese government has been a prominent obstacle in other fora, such as the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), to India's attempts to sanction terrorists based in Pakistan.While not mentioning Pakistan, Gen Singh, who was attending the meet as External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was unable to travel for health reasons, struck an optimistic note in a press conference following his summit with the foreign ministers of Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa. He said ""all BRICS countries agreed that terrorism is the common enemy of humankind and are fully concerned about the threat of terrorism in its various forms and manifestations"".""On behalf of India, I pointed out that terrorism remains one of the most potent global menaces. We did bring out that it threatens global peace and terrorists cannot be differentiated by calling them good or bad,"" he said.""They are terrorists and they are criminals and we need to have a concerted action both in the region and internationally to curb their activities,"" he said.""We have a consensus among the BRICS countries that all (forms of) terrorism must be condemned and various measures must be taken to cooperate so that terrorism does not spread and harm any one of our countries"", he added.Gen Singh also called for ""expediting the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at the United Nations which has been pending for some time"" and said that India ""has the support of all the BRICS countries"" on this issue.'CHINA ALSO A VICTIM OF TERROR'Yet how much India's push will find support in China remains unclear.

""With colleagues today including Indian colleagues China shares the same position.""Gen Singh noted that BRICS launched a joint working group on counter-terrorism which held a meeting last month. He also said National Security Adviser Ajit Doval will likely travel to Beijing next month for a BRICS NSAs meet that will also discuss terror and security cooperation.""The BRICS agenda has witnessed steady expansion,"" Gen Singh said. ""The joint working group on counter terror concluded its meeting in May. Our NSAs are scheduled to meet next month. In their meeting last year, they reached significant understanding to enhance BRICS cooperation in security and counter-terrorism"".""India attaches utmost importance to engagement with BRICS countries,"" he added.

INDIA WANTS BRICS GROUP TO PUT OUT STRONG STATEMENT ON TERRORIndia will want the BRICS grouping to put out a strong statement on terrorism as it holds a summit in Xiamen, southern China, in September which PM Narendra Modi will attend.On Sunday, both countries looked to bring recently strained relations back on track as Gen Singh held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. He said ""India looks forward to strengthening and deepening its strategic partnership and mutual dialogue with China.""Wang was quoted as saying by the official Xinhua news agency that ""China and India are both major countries with great influence, and that they should boost cooperation in the BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and all other multilateral frameworks to make contribution to peace and stability in the region and the world at large.""This is the first major visit from India after Delhi became the only major country to boycott President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road summit on May 14.External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj had been scheduled to attend Monday's first ever standalone BRICS foreign ministers' meeting. Previous interactions among the foreign ministers of the grouping had only been held on the sidelines of other summit - but as Gen Singh told Wang, ""She wanted to come but then health and other restrictions on her did not permit her. But she was looking forward to meeting you.""The ministers on Monday called on Chinese President Xi Jinping. Xi's government is going all out to ensure the BRICS summit in September, which Xi will host in Xiamen in Fujian province where he was earlier a provincial leader, will be seen as a success, with the Communist Party of China also hosting a key once-in-five-year leadership congress, likely to be held in Beijing the following month.

An agreement to this regard was inked by Minister of State for Minority Affairs (Independent Charge) Naqvi with Saudi Arabias Haj and Umrah Minister Dr Mohammad Saleh bin Taher Benten at Jeddah today, making the expansion effective from the current year. The Saudi authorities had five years ago slashed quotas for foreign pilgrims coming from each country by 20 per cent in view of safety of the devotees as they undertook expansion of Grand Mosque there. Accordingly, India's quota was brought down to 1.36 lakh from nearly 1.70 lakh in 2012. Expressing pleasure at signing of the agreement, Naqvi said his meeting with Benten was ""very fruitful"" as constructive discussion was held on the whole gamut of issues related to the pilgrimage, transport and accommodation facilities for pilgrims and their safety. ""On behalf of the people and Government of India, we also extend gratitude to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Excellency Saudi Arabia King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, for his keen personal interest and initiative in organising a successful Haj 2016,"" Naqvi said in a statement. SAUDI ARABIAN LEADERSHIP Naqvi exuded confidence that under the visionary leadership of Saudi Arabias King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, the ""excellent"" relationship between India and Saudi Arabia will be further strengthened. Stating India and Saudi Arabia share ideals of global peace, progress and prosperity, Naqvi said the two countries are tied together with strong civilisational, cultural, economic and political links. ""The regular visits by the leaders and senior-level officials of the two nations have further strengthened the relationship between the two nations. The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Saudi Arabia during April last year added new dimensions to our vibrant relationship,"" he said. The Minister also expressed satisfaction over the improvements in services offered to pilgrims which indicates Saudi Arabias firm commitment towards welfare and betterment of pilgrims. The NDA government has started issuing Haj applications from January 2. The last date for submission of applications is January 24. As part of its efforts to streamline the process, the government has urged pilgrims to submit their applications online. In December last year, a new Haj website was launched which provides all necessary information to Haj pilgrims, the statement said. "

Nearly 500 protesters had pelted stones at the police during the protest demanding that the facility be opened to pilgrims immediately. The facility has remained sealed since its inauguration last year.,"The Ghaziabad police arrested three persons and lodged an FIR under sections of the IPC and Criminal Law Amendment Act against them. Also, 14 persons were booked for causing damage to public property.The police have also named the involvement of 300-400 unidentified persons for inciting violence near ?Ala Hazrat Haj House? on Monday night.Those arrested include Naseem Khan, district president of Congress? minority cell and Puja Chaddha, the district president of Congress? women?s cell. Other Congress leaders have also been named in the FIR, in which the police alleged that 14 police personnel, including four sub-inspectors and a woman constable, were injured.?The FIR is lodged at Sahibabad police station and we have arrested three persons in this connection. Teams are on the lookout for other persons and trying to identify them through video footage,? Akash Tomar, superintendent of police (city), said.A large number of locals and Congress workers started gathering outside the Haj House near river Hindon from Monday afternoon, despite prohibitory orders in place in the district. The police also charged them under Section 188 of the IPC, which is applied only when prohibitory orders are violated.?Naseem Khan and Puja Chaddha are not traceable. We will protest against the police and the administration and will also hand them a memorandum about the lathi charge carried out by police on innocent people who were staging a peaceful dharna outside the Haj House. There were some miscreants who resorted to violence but they were outsiders,? said Harendra Kasana, district president of the Congress.For the last one week, since the Haj pilgrimage is on, locals have been demanding that the newly constructed Haj House, which was inaugurated by former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in September 2016, be opened.However, the Haj House is caught up in litigation after three residents approached the National Green Tribunal and demanded its demolition, contending that the structure was built on land chunks of the Hindon floodplains.The tribunal on September 2, 2016, had said in its order, ?We make it clear that any steps or construction taken in the meanwhile shall be subject to the orders of the Tribunal passed in this Application (sic).?Earlier on July 27, Hindustan Times had published a report listing the reasons for closure of the facility. In response, UP minister Mohsin Raza had said that the decision not to make the Haj House operational was taken by the previous government (led by former Akhilesh Yadav) and the present government is continuing the same.?The decision was already taken by the previous government as the matter was with NGT even before the present government assumed office. The decision was taken to protect the environment and the river ecology. The influx of thousands of pilgrims is bound to create garbage issues in the river zone. This decision was taken earlier to avoid being in contempt of court,? Raza had said.In the meantime, the district administration has deployed police and provincial armed constabulary personnel outside the Haj House and are keeping a tight vigil on activities that may lead to an escalation of law and order."

Speaking during the Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha yesterday, Sushma said, ""We have not accepted this list and have sought more details. We have said that it is only after we verify the details, can we issue an emergency certificate for their deportation."" 'NO CHANGE IN US POLICIES'Addressing the concerns expressed by some Rajya Sabha MPs, Sushma said it would not be correct to say that there has been a change in the US policies after the Trump administration has come to power.Several members expressed concern over the effects of the steps being taken by the Donald Trump administration on Indian citizens including skilled professionals living there.Referring to skilled workers, Swaraj said regarding H1B and L1 visas for professionals, four bills have come to the US Congress but they have not been passed.PROFESSIONALS VS ILLEGAL MIGRANTSShe said the government was engaging with the US at the highest level to ensure that the interests of Indian people or the IT industry are not affected.""We are conveying to them that IT professionals are not stealing jobs but contributing to the US economy and making it stronger,"" the Minister said.While greeting Swaraj on her recovery after having been unwell, Anand Sharma of Congress said it is important that skilled professionals are not confused with illegal migrants.Swaraj said she had earlier stated that some Bills have been moved in the US, but the government was taking steps so that they are not passed in such a form. She said the Foreign Secretary had met US Congress members who had been all praise for Indians.'OLD CONCERNS PACKAGED NEW' Even in 2012, a figure had come that 11.43 lakh migrants lived there, of whom 2.60 lakh were Indians. ""We did not accept the figure because it cannot be considered authentic without thorough verification,"" she said.She said ""there are no authentic figures on the number of undocumented Indian immigrants in the US"", adding that the government provided travel documents only after the concerned person was conclusively identified as Indian.""In case we don't provide travel documents, they would be jailed,"" Swaraj said, adding that from 2014 till date, 576 people have been provided travel documents.Responding to questions on social security, she said these issues have been raised in the past and can be taken up again later ""as you say right now a sword is hanging on jobs"".On H1B visas, she said there have been ""flip-flops"" in the past and the number of these visas rose from 65,000 to 1.95 lakh and then again went down to 65,000. ""It is not that all these changes have happened only after the Trump administration has taken over,"" she said."

The administration was forced to withdraw the decision within 24 hours of issuing the circular after it received flak from employees and was slammed on social media.,"The Daman and Diu administration on Wednesday withdrew a circular that asked women staff to tie rakhis on male colleagues after the order triggered a backlash from employees and was ripped apart on social media.The union territory?s administration was forced to retreat within 24 hours of issuing the circular that made it compulsory for its staff to celebrate Rakshabandhan at workplace.?It has been decided to celebrate the festival of Rakshabandhan on August 7. In this connection, all offices/ departments shall remain open and celebrate the festival collectively at a suitable time wherein all the lady staff shall tie rakhis to their colleagues,? the order, issued on August 1 by Gurpreet Singh, deputy secretary (personnel), had said.To ensure that no one skipped office, an attendance report was to be sent to the government the next evening.The two notifications ? one mandating the celebration of Rakshabandhan (left) and the other withdrawing the mandate (right) ? were issued by the Daman and Diu administration a day apart. The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous. There are sensitivities involved. How can the government dictate who I should tie rakhi to? We should maintain the professionalism of a workplace? an official told Hindustan Times earlier in the day. She refused to be identified.The notice was issued on Daman and Diu administrator and former Gujarat home minister Praful Kodabhai Patel?s direction, sources said.Rakshabandhan, a celebration of the bond between brothers and sisters, is one of several Hindu festivities and rituals that are no longer confined of private, family affairs but have become tools to push politic al ideologies.In 2014, the year BJP stormed to power at the Centre, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said the festival had ?national significance? and should be celebrated widely ?to protect Hindu culture and live by the values enshrined in it?. The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival."

The farmers reportedly justified their demand by quoting the ?1 crore acquisition rate in Mumbai-Goa highway project and ?52 lakh to ?5.2 crore per hectare rate in Mumbai-Nagpur expressway project.,"The proposed West Coast Refinery and Petrochemical project seems to have run into trouble, as farmers in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg have asked the state government to hike the land acquisition rate to Rs1crore a hectare ? at par with the Mubmbai-Nagpur super communication highway. The project, which is estimated to cost Rs2.5 lakh crore, needs 6,018 hectares of land from around 3,000 farmers in 16 villages in two districts. The state government in May issued a notification under the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) Act, clarifying its intent to acquire land for the project. The project has been proposed by three government-controlled oil marketing companies with the stakes of the Centre and the state governments. The state has followed the acquisition formula adopted for the Jaitapur nuclear power plant in 2013. Farmers in Jaitapur have opposed the land acquisition rate: Rs 22.50 lakh a hectare. In a meeting with Ravindra Chavan, minister of ports and medical education, a delegation of farmers quoted the rate given to Mumbai-Nagpur and Mumbai-Pune expressways and raised 27 demands, including Rs1crore a hectare. ?The delegation expressed its displeasure over the rate being offered to farmers. The government paid Rs1crore a hectare in the Mumbai-Goa highway road widening project and Rs52 lakh to Rs5.2 crore a hectare for the Mumbai-Nagpur corridor. The next meeting has been convened by industries minister Subhash Desai on July 24,? said an official from MIDC.Shiv Sena alleged that the project would disturb the bio-diversity, increase pollution levels and destroy farmers? livelihood. In a climbdown of sorts, it now says that if farmers are ready to handover their land, it has no objection. ?If our 27 demands are fulfilled, we have no objection to the project,? Rajan Salvi, Shiv Sena MLA from Rajapur, told HT.?I am sure the BJP-led government at the Centre and in the state will fulfil all these demands,? said Pramod Jathar former BJP MLA from Kankavali."

Of the 437 punished personnel, seven were inspectors, 73 sub-inspectors, 19 assistant sub-inspectors, 65 head constables and 271 were constables. ?The sharp decline in complaints received against police personnel is a result of the sustained emphasis laid by us and prompt inquiry into complaints followed by swift punitive action on substantiated allegations. The force has adopted a zero-tolerance policy against corruption, inaction and misbehaviour by police personnel. The perception created among staff that if found guilty, they will not be spared has helped us contain corruption in the department,? said Dependra Pathak, Delhi Police spokesperson.

It also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh for the injured.On the night of September 11, 2008, Bhasin ? then a BBA student ? had crushed Anuj Chauhan and his friend, Mrigank Srivastava, under his BMW car at Moolchand in South Delhi. While Chauhan died in a city hospital, Srivastava survived the accident. Bhasin was arrested from ISBT Kashmere Gate while he was fleeing to Chandigarh.Though the court had passed the verdict in May, the quantum of punishment was pronounced only on Saturday. It also granted statutory bail to Bhasin, enabling him to file an appeal in the high court. The bail bond was fixed at Rs 50,000 with surety of a similar amount.Bhasin was earlier cleared of culpable homicide, which provides for a maximum jail term of up to 10 years.The court said a copy of the judgment must be sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, so he can consider steps to enhance the punishment prescribed for such offences under section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code. The judge also quoted a song from the movie Jindagi aur Toofan ? which goes ?Aadmi chahe toh taqdeer badal sakte hai, poori duniya ki woh tasveer badal sakte hai, aadmi soch toh le uska irada kya hai (Humankind can change its fate if it wants to, can change the entire picture of the world if it wants to, as long as there is a strong resolve to do so)? ? to buttress his point.The court noted that India has a ?disreputable record of road accidents?, with a total of 4.64 lakh road accidents being reported in 2015 alone."

I had to pay around Rs 70,000 for the hotel and more than Rs 40,000 for food. There was a time when I had no money left. I was simply devastated. Moreover, they put my name in 50m Backstroke when it was never my event. I had to write letters to the International Paralympic Committee when a coach was appointed to take care of the swimmers.""The swimmers were also asked to arrange their visas, which cost her additional Rs 15,000. To add to the misery, Kanchanmala, who won a bronze at the 2011 World Para Games, was shocked to see that the PCI had registered her in the 50m Backstroke event when she had actually applied for the 100m Backstroke.'HORROR SHOW'In her own words, Kanchanmala's Europe trip was no less than a ""horror show"". The coach Kanchanmala refers to is Kanwaljeet Singh, the man sent by the PCI to assist the para-swimmers.Singh was allegedly of almost no help, often going missing during the main events while also going to the extent of asking for 90 pounds (Rs 7,462) as participation fee.""He (Singh) didn't help me at all. I used to go back to the hotel just with my escort and god knows where he used to be. Once, I took a tram from the tournament venue to my hotel and I had no money. I had to travel without ticket and was caught by the checker who later fined me 120 pounds (about Rs 10,000),"" Kanchanmala said.""He (Singh) asked for participation fee from me when it should be PCI paying for all of this. Even though he paid the fee later, I had a very rough time with him. A coach should be helpful and always take care of athletes. I didn't see any of that.""BLAME GAMEHowever, PCI vice-president Gurucharan Singh maintained that the Sports Authority of India (SAI) had not sanctioned the amount for the tournament while also saying that the swimmers will be refunded their money.""We are facing problems from with SAI regarding sanction of amount for championships. The money for swimming championship in Berlin didn't come on time and as the process takes around 3-4 days, we weren't able to provide it to the swimmers,"" he said.""I am here in London for the World Athletics Championship and we are also facing a problem of shortage of money. SAI sanctioned just 40,000 pounds (Rs 33.16 lakh) while the organisers are asking for 80,000 pounds (Rs 66.32 lakh). We will hold meetings with SAI officials to discuss this matter. So, a fix to all this will be done once the London meet is over. I assure you, the swimmers will be given back their money. As for the coach problem, I am not aware of it. As soon as I get back to India, we will talk to the swimmers and will carry out an inquiry if needed.""Despite the frustrations, Kanchanmala fulfilled her dream to qualify for her second World Championship and wants to put all this behind as she aims for more glory in the September meet."

(BCCI treasurer Anirudh Chaudhary tries to create unanimity among members on Champions Trophy boycott threat)A faction in the BCCI had over teleconference contemplated pulling out of the Champions Trophy of which India are title defenders.The decision, Anirudh, said in his letter to the full members, was taken during a conference call which was organised through the BCCI office ""rather than the other channel for obvious reasons."" (No Champions Trophy decision without COA's permission: Vinod Rai to BCCI)COA head Vinod Rai on Tuesday made it clear that BCCI office-bearers are not mandated to take any decision on India's Champions Trophy participation without the COA's approval. Rai's comments came amid continuing speculation on India's Champions Trophy participation after the BCCI was outvoted on its opposition to a revamped revenue and governance model of the ICC.""Yes, we have issued an instruction that any decision regarding the ICC Revenue Model should only be taken at the Special General Meeting (SGM). But the BCCI units have been told that they cannot issue any legal notice to the ICC with regards to Champions Trophy pull-out without our prior approval,"" Rai told PTI.The COA was forced to issue a diktat after it was learnt that around 10 loyalists of former BCCI president N Srinivasan engaged in a teleconference where the options of pulling out and taking legal action against the global body were discussed. (BCCI misses deadline for naming squad)India Today has now learnt that the CoA has written to the state associations telling them that pulling out of the Champions Trophy was not in the best interests of Indian cricket and that it will move Supreme Court if any drastic steps are taken at the BCCI SGM scheduled on May 7. (BCCI isolated at International Cricket Council: Sources to India Today)Here's the CoA letter to the states:1.We have been informed that a Special General Meeting of the BCCI has been convened on May 7, 2017 (""SGM"") to conduct the following business:""To apprise the General Body of the BCCI on the discussions held with representatives of other Member Boards of the ICC and on the decisions taken at the ICC Meetings held on the 24th of April, 2017 and the 26th of April, 2017 and to take all necessary decisions pursuant thereto.""2.We are addressing this communication to you with the intention of putting all relevant factors and issues in their proper perspective when you discuss and take necessary decisions at the SGM. You are all aware that a certain financial model was proposed in 2014 and accepted by the other cricket boards and the same was meant to commence in 2015/2016. However, soon after the said financial model had been accepted, there were discordant voices that emanated from other cricket boards (which have been noted by the General Body of the BCCI in February 2016) and the ICC decided to set up a working group to re-visit the said financial model.3.One of the members of the Committee of Administrators (Mr. Vikram Limaye) had attended the ICC Board meeting in February 2017 on behalf of the BCCI pursuant to the order dated January 30, 2017 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The ICC Board meeting in February 2017 was within a week of the Committee of Administrators being appointed. At the said meeting, Mr. Limaye had proposed that instead of there being any voting on the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model, the same should be taken up during the meetings to be held in April 2017 since there wasn't sufficient time for BCCI to study the proposals and formulate its position. Also, the proposals presented had stated that there was no scientific basis for the revised financial model that was being proposed. However, on the insistence of a majority of the ICC Board, a vote was taken on the approval of the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model. The same were approved 'in-principle' (with only Mr. Limaye and the representative from Sri Lanka Cricket voting against whilst the representative from Zimbabwe Cricket abstained), subject to the right of ICC members to raise any issues they have on the proposals in advance of the meetings to be held in April 2017.4.In order to ensure that the BCCI's stand in relation to the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model was placed on record with the ICC sufficiently in advance of the meetings to be held in April 2017, we instructed the CEO to address a detailed communication dated March 19, 2017 to the ICC (in response to an email addressed by the ICC to Mr. Limaye) setting out our preliminary observations on the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model (See Annexure 1). We understand that this communication has already been brought to your attention during the Special General Meeting held on April 18, 2017. We would like to highlight that the said communication specifically draws the attention of the ICC to the Members Participation Agreement dated 12th October 2014 entered into between the BCCI and IBC (a subsidiary of ICC) (""MPA"") and states that the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model will, if adopted, entitle BCCI to exercise certain rights under the MPA and also to avail remedies under applicable law.5.In order to ascertain the rights and remedies that may be available to BCCI under and in relation to the MPA and otherwise in the event the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model are adopted, the Committee of Administrators had also asked the CEO to obtain necessary legal opinion(s) from appropriate foreign lawyers on the matter. We have been informed that this legal opinion has already been shared with the existing office bearers of the BCCI and we expect that they will appropriately brief you on the same.6.In the meantime, after the ICC Board Meeting held in February 2017, other cricket boards as well as the ICC were desirous of engaging in discussions and their representatives approached the Committee of Administrators for this purpose, since there were no functioning office bearers until the clarification issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on March 24, 2017. During the said discussions, we made it clear to the ICC and other cricket boards that Mr. Limaye had only been asked to attend the meetings to be held in February 2017 and he may not necessarily be asked to attend the meetings to be held in April 2017. Accordingly, the discussions between the ICC, other cricket boards and us were limited to ascertaining their respective positions and scope for negotiation. No commitment whatsoever has been made by us on behalf of the BCCI either to the ICC or to any other cricket board.7.During the course of the said discussions, the ICC and other cricket boards clearly communicated to us that the events that transpired in 2014 had led to an immense trust deficit between them and the BCCI and there was a need for trust-building in order to work together going forward. They acknowledged the fact that BCCI contributes much more to the ICC than other cricket boards and also recognized that BCCI should therefore get its due share under the revised financial model and were prepared to negotiate an amount that would be acceptable to BCCI and other cricket boards. At the same time, they made it clear that the share that was envisaged under the financial model that was put in place in 2014 was too high and not acceptable to them. They believed that a fair share could be something in between what was proposed in 2014 and the new financial model and could be negotiated between BCCI, other cricket boards and the ICC without the need for a vote. Our discussions indicated that the ICC Chairman and other cricket boards were keen to find an acceptable middle ground to resolving this matter in a collaborative/ non-confrontational framework.8.After the order dated April 17, 2017 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court appointing Mr. Amitabh Choudhary as BCCI's representative to the ICC, we had invited the existing office bearers for a meeting on April 21, 2017 so that we could update them on the above developments prior to the ICC meetings. Whilst the Acting President and the Hon. Treasurer expressed their inability to attend the said meeting, the Acting Secretary did meet with us on April 21, 2017 and we briefed him on our prior discussions with the ICC and other cricket boards so that he would be aware of their respective views/ positions.9.We believe that the outcome of the ICC Board Meetings held in Dubai during the last week of April 2017 could have been avoided if the resolutions passed during the Special General Meeting held on April 18, 2017 had authorized the Acting Secretary to arrive at a negotiated outcome (within certain parameters akin to those set out during an earlier Special General Meeting held on February 19, 2016) instead of directing him to either seek deferment of a vote and, if that was not agreed to by the ICC and other cricket boards, vote against the revised ICC governance structure and revised financial model. In fact, we had communicated our apprehension regarding the lack of flexibility available to the Acting Secretary to negotiate when we met him on April 21, 2017.10.The decision regarding what amount/ share and changes to the ICC governance structure the BCCI should finally agree to in the course of negotiations with the ICC and other cricket boards is certainly one that needs to be taken by the General Body of the BCCI as it has long term implications. However, since we have had the benefit of independently interacting with the ICC and other cricket boards as mentioned above, we consider it our duty to communicate our views on the matter to you prior to the SGM:(a) It is extremely unlikely that the ICC and other cricket boards will agree to the amount/ share envisaged under the financial model that was put in place in 2014.(b) The ICC and other cricket boards will certainly agree to an amount/ share that is higher than what is envisaged under the revised financial model.(c) It is in the interests of Indian cricket for the BCCI to continue negotiations with the ICC and other cricket boards to arrive at an amount/ share that is somewhere between that envisaged under the financial model that was put in place in 2014 and that which is envisaged under the revised financial model. An audio recording of the Special General Meeting of the Members of BCCI held on February 19, 2016 reveals that there was a recognition that the BCCI should work in a collaborative framework with ICC and negotiate a lower amount that is acceptable to all. BCCI should continue to adopt this approach in its negotiations with ICC. Specific details of the maximum reduction in the amount/ share that the then President and Secretary of the BCCI were authorized to negotiate and agree were verbally agreed although the same does not find mention in the minutes of the said Special General Meeting.(d) It is not in the interests of Indian cricket for the BCCI to take any drastic step/ measure which may result in breakdown of negotiations between the BCCI, ICC and other cricket boards, especially since there is sufficient time between now and the ICC Conference to be held in June 2017 for a negotiated outcome to be arrived at.11.We are aware that apart from the revised ICC financial model, issues relating to the revised ICC governance structure are also important for the BCCI. This is evident from the fact that a majority of the preliminary observations contained in the detailed communication dated March 19, 2017 addressed by the CEO to the ICC under our instructions (See Annexure 1) are in relation to the revised ICC governance structure viz. scheduling of bilateral tours, membership issues, powers of the ICC Chairman, voting issues, composition of committees, etc. We believe that the way to address these issues is also through negotiation with the ICC and other cricket boards and there is sufficient time between now and the ICC Conference to be held in June 2017 for a negotiated outcome to be arrived at. However, a negotiated outcome may be jeopardized if the BCCI takes any drastic step/ measure at this stage which will only precipitate matters."

","Dozens of street vendors will have to take their wares elsewhere as authorities in Delhi are gearing up to clear the perennial congestion near the neighbouring hospitals AIIMS and Safdarjung.The area will be turned into a ""no hawker zone"" as the encroachers cripple traffic movement and also get in the way of emergency vehicles.Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal has directed the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) chairman to take control of the Ring Road and Aurobindo Marg stretches from the Public Works Department (PWD).The move by the L-G follows repeated complaints from Safdarjung Hospital authorities that doctors and patients get delayed in reaching the institute on time as they get stuck in traffic outside.Dr AK Rai, director of Safdarjung Hospital, told Mail Today, ""I have been getting complaints from patients' relatives, doctors and other hospital staff on being late in reaching the hospital when it's the need of the hour.

Adding that he had not met President Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower, Tillerson said, ""When he asked me...to be Secretary of State, I was stunned.""","Rex Tillerson has said he did not want to be US secretary of state and only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it.The former ExxonMobil oil executive revealed his initial reluctance in an interview published after a controversial trip to Asia and hours before the biggest event of his two months at the state department, an international meeting on Wednesday about how to fight Islamic State (Isis).  ?I didn?t want this job. I didn?t seek this job,? Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation Asia trip. ?My wife told me I?m supposed to do this.?He said he had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect ?about the world? and his experiences as an oil company CEO.?When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,? he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at ExxonMobil, he had expected to retire: ?I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.?However, he said that when he returned to his Texas home after meeting Trump in New York, his wife, Renda St Clair, shook her finger in his face and said: ?I told you God?s not through with you.?He said he now feels his wife had been right: ?I?m supposed to do this.?Not everyone shares that view. Tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country?s top diplomat at the beginning of February. He was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration?s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of Muslim countries.He has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. He did not take the Washington diplomatic press corps with him on his Asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. The sole exception was the journalist from the IJR, a little-known outlet founded by a former Republican operative. The initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.He told the IJR: ?I?m not a big media press access person. I personally don?t need it. I understand it?s important to get the message of what we?re doing out, but I also think there?s only a purpose in getting the message out when there?s something to be done.?When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: ?He was so cagey ? his answer wasn?t even worthy of inclusion.?Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. Senior Republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the White House would not pass Congress. In his remarks to the IJR, however, Tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the US diplomatic establishment.?Looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we?re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,? he said. He said he had not yet talked to Trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: ?We haven?t gotten that far yet.?While in South Korea, Tillerson was reported in the Seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling Korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. In response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. ?They never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn?t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn?t have dinner because I was tired,? he told the IJR. On Tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged Tillerson would skip what would have been his first Nato foreign ministers? meeting in early April in Brussels so he could be in Florida for Trump?s first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The state department spokesman, Mark Toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to Nato and that Tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-Isis meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible Nato meeting."

""Modi as CM always opposed GST,"" he said.When asked whether the Congress boycott of the Parliament session is to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Sharma said he is only an individual. ""Our boycott is not targeted against an individual,"" he said.When Sardesai reminded Sharma that the government had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to share the dais with Modi, Sharma said an ""invitation to Dr Singh was not a favour"".Also Read:Complete GST Midnight Conclave coverageThere are glitches in GST, will fix them: Venkaiah at Tryst With Tax ConclaveGST: Retailers, stressed about 37 returns?

The farmers were staging a protest demanding a hiked compensation for the land being acquired by the government for the construction of the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The farmers of Bil Akbarpur village marched to Dadri tehsil and asked the administration for an unconditional release of the farmers.Also, the farmers have decided to presently accept the compensation of Rs3,640 per square metre offered by the district administration for acquiring their land. However, they said that they will challenge the acquisition in the court for enhanced compensation, as their counterparts in Ghaziabad have received compensation up to Rs17,000 per square metre.The farmers held a meeting with the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, BN Singh, on Monday on the issue but could not arrive at a consensus.Teja Gurjar, a farmer leader said, ?The administration has agreed to release the arrested farmers, but has asked us not to obstruct work on Eastern Peripheral Expressway.?The district magistrate said, ?I have met the farmers and have agreed to release the arrested men on the condition that they provide an affidavit that they will not indulge in anti-social activities such as blocking rail routes or obstructing construction work at the expressway site.? The compensation will be awarded as per the government norms and court?s orders, said Singh.Farmers of 39 villages in Greater Noida and adjoining areas had joined hands in protest on Friday, demanding enhanced compensation and said they had decided not to give their agricultural land for the compensation amount proposed by the government.In 2016, the compensation rate was decided at Rs3,500 per square metre, which was enhanced to Rs3,640 per square metre in 2017.

Following the loss, the 38-year-old broke down and was also seen crying on his coach's shoulders. It was Cormier's second loss of his MMA career, with the first also having come against Jones.","Jon Jones had barely reclaimed his UFC title when he called out Brock Lesnar to be his next opponent.And Lesnar was listening.Right after Jones stopped Daniel Cormier in the third round at UFC 214 on Saturday, he reignited his growing rivalry with Lesnar, the former UFC heavyweight champion.?Brock Lesnar, if you want to know what it feels like to get your ass kicked by a guy who weighs 40 pounds less than you, meet me in the octagon,? Jones said on the pay-per-view broadcast.The Associated Press reached Lesnar shortly after he watched the championship fight and then heard Jones call him out.?Be careful what you wish for, young man,? Lesnar replied.A heavyweight superfight between Jones and Lesnar would be one of the biggest events in UFC history. Lesnar is an extraordinary pay-per-view draw as likely the most popular fighter in mixed martial arts, while Jones? victory over Cormier is expected to put him back atop most pound-for-pound lists as the world?s best fighter.Lesnar returned to MMA last year with a victory, but he is under contract to the WWE as a professional wrestler until next spring.Jones and Lesnar traded verbal jabs earlier in the week. After Jones said he doubted Lesnar would ever accept a fight with him, Lesnar told the AP that he would meet Jones ?anytime, anywhere.?Lesnar is at least considering a return to the sport in which he won a UFC title in just his fourth professional fight.UFC president Dana White was in the cage when Jones called out Lesnar, and the promotion is aware of the growing buzz surrounding the matchup. White is also aware of the obstacles in its way, including the remainder of Lesnar?s suspension for failing a doping test last year.?It?s fun to talk about, but the reality of it happening anytime soon, it?s not a reality,? White said.But it?s definitely a lucrative possibility if Lesnar decides to resume training for MMA. Jones is the light heavyweight champion, but has long contemplated a move up to heavyweight ? and his post-fight comments make it clear that he?s interested.Lesnar beat Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in a unanimous decision that was changed to a no-contest after the failed test. He received a one-year suspension from the Nevada Athletic Commission, but could return to MMA after completing the final months of the ban."

He said that as technology is transitioning, companies must invest in retraining employees and employees must invest time in learning. He also said that automation has impacted services like infrastructure management and maintenance.","Hyderabad, Jul 25 (PTI) As growth rate slows down, Indian IT companies need to learn to manage expectations of their employees, says a senior industry figure as he pitched for retraining of staff, in the era of rapid technology transition. When growth rate slows down, one has to manage the expectations of the employees within the company, former CEO of Bengaluru-headquartered IT major, Infosys, Kris Gopalakrishnan said. ""The number of promotions will come down because there are no openings at higher levels. So, you have to set expectations properly"", he told PTI. Secondly, the former President of Confederation of Indian Industry said, technology is transitioning and, so, employees will have to be retrained. ""One, the company must invest in retraining employees, and two, employees must invest time in learning. So, these are stressful situations for both employees as well as leadership in the companies"", Gopalakrishnan said. Last month, Indian IT industry body NASSCOM projected software export growth in 2017-18 at 7-8 per cent in constant currency, down from 8.6 per cent in the previous fiscal. The industry would add 130,000-150,000 jobs in the current financial year, it had forecast. Gopalakrishnan, the Chairman of Axilor Ventures, an early stage startup accelerator and venture fund, rejected suggestions that there is job-crisis in the Indian IT sector. ""Even NASSCOM has projected this sector will add one lakh-plus jobs this year also. Yes, growth rate has come down, recruitment numbers are lower but its still positive and the industry is still recruiting people"", he said. Gopalakrishnan, however, said hiring is slowing down because growth rate has come down. ""There have been some impact of automation on certain services. For example, infrastructure management services, maintenance services where automation has had an impact. Several tasks can be automated and those services will require less number of people. ""Now these are services where the work is actually quite repetitive and in the long run, these tasks are better done by machines because they are repetitive"", he said. Gopalakrishnan also shared his thoughts on opportunities and challenges for the industry in the coming decade, a period he said would be exciting for the sector as every industry is transitioning, and IT companies need to be ""reimaginative"" in helping such industries in the process.

The family had said it wanted to know whether the girl's death was suicide and, if so, whether it was the consequence of online bullying.","The parents of a dead 15-year-old who appealed to Facebook to allow them access to her account to see if she was being bullied before her death have lost their claim in court.Berlin?s court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that the parents of the teenager, who died in 2012 after falling in front of an underground train, had no claim to access her details or chat history. The ruling goes against the decision made in an initial judgment by the regional court in 2015. It raises fresh questions over digital inheritance and who has the right to manage someone?s online presence and intellectual property when they die.The court said it had made the ruling according to the telecommunications secrecy law which precludes heirs from viewing the communications of a deceased relative with a third party. Before the ruling both Facebook and the parents of the girl, whose identity has not been made public, reserved the right in the event of a defeat to take an appeal to Germany?s federal court of justice in Karlsruhe. The judge said they were free to do so, but the parents have not confirmed that this is what they still intend to do.The family have said they are desperate to find out whether the girl?s death in Berlin was suicide and, if so, whether it was the consequence of online bullying. They have said they want Facebook to allow access to chats she might have had online which might provide a clue as to the cause of their daughter?s unexpected death.The girl had reportedly given her mother the login details to her account when she was 14 but the company, having been informed of the girl?s death by one of her Facebook friends, froze or ?memorialised? her account. The move meant that photos and posts the girl had shared remained visible, and friends could pay tribute to her, but it was no longer possible to log in to the account. Facebook has refused to say who applied for the account to be frozen, also citing data protection. The person who lodged the request would have had to provide Facebook with proof that the girl had died. The US social media company has repeatedly rejected the parents? request, arguing that in the event messages from a user are revealed, other users would also be exposed. They argue that the conversations would have taken place on the understanding that their content remained private.In its 2015 ruling, Berlin?s regional court ruled in favour of the mother, arguing that the contents of the daughter?s Facebook account should be owned by her heirs. The judge insisted then that Facebook chats should be regarded no differently to the girl?s letters and diaries which her parents automatically inherited. Facebook appealed against that ruling, which is why the case was heard by the court of appeal. The ruling on Wednesday was based on weighing up inheritance laws drawn up almost 120 years ago and the rights of parents towards minors, with the telecommunications secrecy law introduced to protect the privacy of telephone conversations which was updated by the constitutional court in 2009 to include emails. BjÃ¶rn Retzlaff, the judge who ruled in Berlin, deemed that the same rules applied to internet chats. ?That is at the centre of our decision,? Retzlaff told the court, stressing at the same time that the decision had been a difficult one.In a statement in German to the media Facebook said it welcomed the ruling, adding: ?At the same time we are sympathetic towards the family and respect their wish. We are making every effort to find a solution which helps the family at the same time as protecting the privacy of third parties who are also affected by this.?The case recalls that of an Italian architect who appealed to Apple?s chief executive, Tim Cook, last year to unblock his dead 13-year-old son?s iPhone so he could download the photographs stored on it.

A total of 10,184 cases, receiving fines totalling 8.7 million yuan, were due to pollution from mobile emission sources. Among these, more than 10,000 vehicles were punished for excessive exhaust emissions. Fines totalling 142 million yuan, involving 2,943 cases, were issued for fixed pollution emission sources. Nearly half of these violations were reported for air pollution, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Beijing authorities carried out a series of measures to tackle air pollution in 2016, such as cutting coal consumption, ordering construction sites to reduce dust, and removing high-polluting vehicles from roads, it said. The city of over 21 million people is just recovering from nearly two-week-long bout of heavy air pollution during which the city has announced formation of environment police force to crackdown down on factories not following regulations. Beijing has a four-tier alert system for pollution, with red the highest, followed by orange, yellow and blue. Also, more than 5,600 environmental protection violation cases were filed in two Chinese provinces last year. Fines totalling 420 million yuan (USD 60.6 million), involving 4,242 cases, were issued from January to November last year in the central province of Henan.

The statue is believed to date back to the late 12th to early 13th century. Angkor was the capital of the Khmer Empire, which dates from the 9th to the 15th centuries. ","Archaeologists have unearthed a large, centuries-old statue that is believed to have once stood guard over an ancient hospital at Cambodia?s famed Angkor temple complex.The nearly two metre tall carving, which is thought to be from the late 12th to the early 13th century, was discovered during a dig on Saturday, said Long Kosal, a spokesman for Apsara Authority ? the state agency charged with managing the complex. The Angkor Archeological Park, a world heritage site, contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, dating from the 9th to the 15th centuries, and is Cambodia?s most popular tourist destination.At the height of its power the city and its hundreds of temples boasted more than a million inhabitants, making it one of the world?s most populous pre-industrial centres. Huge swathes of the park have been excavated over the decades, creating a walkable archaeological wonder that attracts more than two million visitors a year.

Ankush Verma,07-2017,UK unveils new banknote featuring novelist Jane Austen,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/18/jane-austen-banknote-unveiled-with-strange-choice-of-quotation?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"The Bank of England on Tuesday unveiled a new polymer Â£10 note featuring 19th century novelist Jane Austen, in a move to replace paper Â£5, Â£10 and Â£20 with secure plastic notes. This makes Austen the only woman other than Queen Elizabeth to be featured on a polymer British banknote. The note's introduction marks the 200th anniversary of Austen's death.","The new Â£10 note featuring Jane Austen has been unveiled on the 200th anniversary of the author?s death, complete with a quote about reading ? said by one of her characters who has no interest in books. Austen becomes the first female writer (following in the footsteps of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens) to feature on a banknote.The note, launched by the Bank of England at Austen?s resting place, Winchester Cathedral, includes an image of the writer and one of her most beloved characters, Elizabeth Bennet. There are also illustrations of her writing table and her brother Edward Austen Knight?s home, Godmersham Park in Kent, thought to be a source of inspiration. But it is the quote that will raise eyebrows among Austen enthusiasts. At first glance the line from Pride and Prejudice ? ?I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!? ? seems a good choice. However, the words were spoken by one of Austen?s most deceitful characters, Caroline Bingley, who has no interest in books. She is sidling up to Mr Darcy, whom she would like as a husband. He is reading a book, so she sits next to him and pretends to read alongside him. Speaking at Winchester Cathedral, the Bank of England?s governor, Mark Carney, explained why Austen was chosen ? and the technical aspects of the notes.  He said: ?Our banknotes serve as repositories of the country?s collective memory, promoting awareness of the United Kingdom?s glorious history and highlighting the contributions of its greatest citizens. ?Austen?s novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published.? Turning to practical matters, he said: ?The new Â£10 will be printed on polymer, making it safer, stronger and cleaner. The note will also include a new tactile feature on the Â£10 to help the visually impaired, ensuring the nation?s money is as inclusive as possible.? It joins the Churchill Â£5 in the first family of polymer UK banknotes; a Â£20 note featuring JMW Turner will follow in 2020. The Â£10 note has security features that the Bank says make it very difficult to counterfeit. It is expected to last at least two-and-a-half times longer than paper Â£10 notes ? about five years in total.  The new tactile feature is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner, developed in conjunction with the RNIB, the charity that supports people with sight loss. This is in addition to the elements already incorporated in UK banknotes for visually impaired people: the tiered sizing, bold numerals, raised print and differing colour palettes.Austen fans will have to wait until later this year before they can begin to use the notes. They will be issued on 14 September and the public will begin to see them in the following days and weeks. The Bank hopes featuring Austen will help it counter accusations of sexism for not featuring more women on notes. The author follows Florence Nightingale and Elizabeth Fry in featuring on notes.Tuesday?s banknote launch is one of a series of events taking place to mark the 200th anniversary of Austen?s death, including the unveiling of a statue in Basingstoke, near her birthplace. Austen, who wrote keenly about money, might have been interested in research from Aviva claiming that the Â£10 pound note has a relative purchasing power of only 13p compared with what it could buy in 1817."

The group behind the initiative is also developing a mobile phone app - Rescue Me - which hotel staff can use to alert local police and senior anti-trafficking officers if they see suspicious behavior. ""Hotels are breeding grounds for human trade,"" said Sanee Awsarmmel, chairman of the alumni group of Maharashtra State Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology. ""(We) have hospitality professionals working in hotels across the country. We are committed to this cause.""The initiative, spearheaded by the alumni group and backed by the Maharashtra state government, comes amid growing international recognition that hotels have a key role to play in fighting modern day slavery. MAHARASHTRA MAJOR DESTINATION FOR TRAFFICKED GIRLS Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is a major destination for trafficked girls who are lured from poor states and nearby countries on the promise of jobs, but then sold into the sex trade or domestic servitude. With rising property prices, some traditional red light districts like those in Mumbai have started to disappear pushing the sex trade underground into private lodges and hotels, which makes it hard for police to monitor.Awsarmmel said hotels would be told about 50 signs that staff needed to watch out for.These include requests for rooms with a view of the car park which are favored by traffickers as they allow them to vet clients for signs of trouble and check out their cars to gauge how much to charge.Awsarmmel said hotel staff often noticed strange behavior such as a girl's reticence during the check-in process or her dependence on the person accompanying her to answer questions and provide her proof of identity.But in most cases, staff ignore these signs or have no idea what to do, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RESCUE ME APP The Rescue Me app - to be launched in a couple of months - will have a text feature where hotel staff can fill in details including room numbers to send an alert to police.Human trafficking is the world's fastest growing criminal enterprise worth an estimated $150 billion a year, according to the International Labor Organization, which says nearly 21 million people globally are victims of forced labor and trafficking.Last year, major hotel groups, including the Hilton and Shiva Hotels, pledged to examine their supply chains for forced labor, and train staff how to spot and report signs of trafficking.Earlier this year, Mexico City also launched an initiative to train hotel staff about trafficking.Vijaya Rahatkar, chairwoman of the Maharashtra State Women's Commission, said the initiative would have an impact beyond the state as the alumni group had contact with about a million small hotels across India.The group is also developing a training module on trafficking for hotel staff and hospitality students which could be used across the country.ALSO READFYI | Legal revenge: Child sex trafficking survivors get 'School of Justice' to fight their own battlesMumbai: Woman DJ arrested in high-profile sex racket case"

Mind you, it could be worse... For one thing, South Africa could have had AB de Villiers, Dale Steyn and Kagiso Rabada in their ranks. For another, they could have held one of those early chances offered by Joe Root at Lord?s, in which case they might well be 2-0 up with two to play. An email from Andrew Benton. ?The next Test will be the measure of Root?s captaincy. Can he make the changes necessary, and/or inspire the team? We should give him the series, only then can we pass judgement.? And even that might be a bit premature. I can?t see him losing the job before the Ashes, can you?

It?s an ill wind etc etc, as shown by this email from Smylers. ?An upside of England managing to lose this Test inside four days is that tomorrow?s England Women?s World Cup semi-final against South Africa will now be live on the radio. After I complained about the men overshadowing the women?s exciting ODI against Australia, it seems only fair to credit Joe Root?s team with their swift improvement in this area.?

England only have four problem areas. First, the top order: they?re all left-handers, they?re all crabby, and with Alastair Cook?s form fading, they all struggle to deal with the stock Test-match delivery. In 12 innings, Cook, Keaton Jennings and Gary Ballance have made 246 at an average of 20, which is one shaky set of foundations. Second, Mark Wood. The quickest of England?s bowlers has also been the least incisive: he has one for 197 off 56 overs. Chris Woakes?s recovery from injury cannot come too soon.Third, Liam Dawson. A resourceful cricketer who bowled one great ball to dismiss Amla at Lord?s, Dawson is summed up by one stat: in his whole career, he has taken five wickets in a first-class innings three times. The equivalent figure for Adil Rashid is 19. As a pair, Rashid and Moeen Ali may be expensive, but at least they are penetrating. Dawson is not. He is a bits-and-pieces player who is not even making runs.Fourth, the balance of the side. The batting order is more like a disorder ? too quiet at first, then too noisy, with three blockers followed by Root and four dashers. The selectors can be faulted for two things: preferring Dawson to Rashid, and picking only four specialist batsmen ? two of whom, Jennings and Ballance, are now walking wickets.Updated

On a day like this, we?re all armchair selectors. And some wise heads are already gathering for the meeting...Jeremy Smith: ?The reality is that England?s best number three is still Jonathan Trott, a 36-year-old who retired from international cricket two years ago on health grounds.?Zia Faruqui: ?Are Buttler or Morgan really the solution? Surely both play in the same single devil-may-care mode as the current incumbents? Need Hameed back.?Neil Virani: ?I?m quite amazed by people calling for Test players based on ODI performances. This match and several before are an indictment of employing a Test coach based on his short-form record. Bayliss seems to think every Test pitch is 500 par and every ODI pitch 350 par, and refuses to tell his team to adapt to the conditions.?Ashley Roberts: ?We need to talk about Bayliss. He has been in the job for a few years now but I?m struggling to see how he has improved this Test team. England have batted appallingly in this match, but I think they are a lot more talented than this, which begs the question: why are they all giving their wickets away? Shouldn?t the coach have some influence over that and their type of play? We are seeing these England collapses time and again under Bayliss and, while the players have to accept responsibility, so does he.?Updated

A sharp point from the tireless John Starbuck. ?Du Plessis now has only two Tests to knock the England captain from his perch. It must be a standard Saffer objective now. ?Still,? he adds, ?Trent Bridge lived up to its reputation as another three-day Test ground. You?ve got to laugh.?

3.09pm BST
15:09

So England were awful, but isn?t this great for the series? There is nothing worse than back-to-back Tests producing an instant 2-0, especially when there are only two Tests to come. The series has ebbed and flowed already, which is the life-blood of Test cricket. There?s now a week off, and a chance for England to regroup.

3.06pm BST
15:06

The first thing to say is not that England were awful, but South Africa were vastly improved. They bowled well, batted resolutely, fielded smartly, and above all they were well led. My colleague Rob Smyth reckons the man of the match should be Faf du Plessis, on the John Abrahams principle, and although it?s unlikely to happen, it may well be right. He came on stage as a very modern version of a deus ex machina: the captain returning from paternity leave. At Lord?s, Joe Root faced another novice at the toss; here, he faced a battle-hardened pro.Updated

44th over: England 133-8 (Dawson 5, Wood 0) And so the dismal procession continues.Our latest selector, ready to do a bit better than the real ones, is Anthony Hulse. ?Picking up on the earlier discussion, it?s difficult to see what there is to lose by playing either of Morgan or Buttler. As has been pointed out, at least they have demonstrated the ability to get runs against international bowling attacks, under the sort of pressure which playing international sport brings. With modern run rates and batting approaches who?s to say there isn?t overall more in common between ODIs and Tests than there is between Tests and county cricket? I?m sure both of them are probably better at keeping out straight deliveries on a length than Gary Ballance is, although that?s not a desperately high bar to clear.?

40th over: England 122-6 (Stokes 17, Dawson 0) Du Plessis rearranged his field specially for Moeen in the first innings, too, and shonuff Moeen obliged then. What happened to the man who mustered that tremendous rearguard against Sri Lanka in 2014?

2.22pm BST
14:22

38th over: England 120-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 25) A rare quiet over for South Africa, Maharaj struggling manfully to stem the flow of runs ... then, after just a single ceded from the over, Moeen drives its final ball, Morkel keels over but can?t stop it properly, and after some tricklage, England add four more. I?ve been sent a fair few messages checking that i was joking about Buttler and solidity - I can confirm that I was. ?You can never be too sure these days; apparently Liam Dawson as a frontline spinner is deadly serious,? snarks Miles Dilworth. However, I would like to see Buttler given another go in Tests, and think the true tracks in Australia will suit him.

37th over: England 115-5 (Stokes 16, Ali 21) Morkel squares Moeen up, only for Moeen to edge and see the ball race away for four. So Moeen restores the karmic balance, going back then leaning forward to drive on the up through extra cover - that?s a lovely shot, and it brings four. I smell a bouncer - and Moeen will too, I shouldn?t wonder. Here?s an email from Graham, harking back to the OBO community of yore: ?Given that England are bound to lose this match before close of play, perhaps now would be a good time to give a shout out to Krakow Cricket Club.

34th over: England 93-5 (Stokes 15, Ali 0) Stokes eases a drive past the dive of mid-off for four, so Maharaj tries a flatter, quicker one - he looks a fine, intelligent bowler I must say.

It?s retro day again! Welcome to the 90s!

29th over: England 83-4 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 5) Morkel takes the ball and rams one into Bairstow?s thigh-pad. Bairstow then follows one around his pads, but can?t quite apply the edge that will send him on his merry way. Instead, he flicks the final delivery for four through midwicket. ?Root?s dislike of Rashid isn?t personal,? reassures John Starbuck, ?it?s because he?s prejudiced against wrist-spinners, who leak more runs but take more wickets than the offies. As a batsman himself, the prospect of having to score more is unwelcome.?I?m not sure about that - I?d imagine he might also consider who and what he?d fancy facing. Maybe he doesn?t deem Rashid?s risk worth the potential reward, but if the batsmen do their job properly they can afford a luxury leg-spinner.

A couple of years ago, I wondered if England should bring Eoin Morgan back into the Test side...Eoin Morgan needs another go in the Test team. Discuss.Not everyone agreed.

?On the Rashid/Root suggestion,? says Ian Truman, ?I?d be interested just how much Root has played with Rashid over the last 5 years, I?d suggest he?s played with him more for the England ODI side (where we?d all agree Rashid has been pretty decent) than he has for Yorkshire.

?Well, this is going well,? says Guy Hornsby of

Brexit
 our proceedings. There was a really good stat on Channel 5 on the weekend showing how little England have bowled on the stumps. Now, I know that this doesn?t necessarily translate to wanting to nick batsmen off when shaping away, but surely Philander?s proved ? like McGrath before him ? that there?s simple value in making the batsman play. It?s death by a thousand cuts, as Atherton, Hussain et al will tell you when it came to the Ashes. Tall bowlers are all well and good but if you?ll never hit the stumps, where?s the pressure? Someone pass me the gin.?Agree with a lot of this, but Morkel has been great so far this series. The difference in this match - in mine - has been the batting more than the bowling. 

1.30pm BST

What a morning for South Africa! Philander was brilliant first up, then Morris and Du Plessis added fresh impetus before the initial impetus had even expired. Sometime this afternoon, this match will end, you?d reckon - join me after lunch to ?enjoy? it.

28th over: England 79-4 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 5) Maharaj will bowl the final over before lunch, and he?s another who?s risen to the occasion - not just here, but at Lord?s. Bairstow uses his feet to take a single into the off side, which means three balls into the rough at Stokes - close by are two silly points. Stokes, though defends well enough, and thus ends another fantastic session for South Africa. Updated

27th over: England 78-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 5) Stokes allows Martin to hit his face, running the ball through third man for four and reducing the target fro 400 and something to a far more manageable 300 and something. This is a fine spell from Morris, just when England might?ve thought themselves relative safe - his performance does not show Mark Wood in a favourable light. So, who comes in and who goes out for the Oval? I guess I?d keep Wood and Jennings but bin Dawson and Ballance. 

12.54pm BST
12:54

26th over: England 74-4 (Bairstow 11, Stokes 1) Bairstow adds one with a sweep and then Stokes props forward tentatively, imparting an edge which cues strangulated shouts. Nasser points out that Stokes? gloves are very low, inviting the ball to run up them for a catch when he should be booting it away. Silly point comes in, and a shove towards mid on averts the additional embarrassment of a pair.  ?Not so long ago that Bairstow and Stokes added 399 against South Africa,? emails Peter Salmon; some of you might remember that he is in the pub. I?m not sure he?ll be getting served too many more.

12.49pm BST

25th over: England 72-4 (Bairstow 10, Stokes 0) Du Plessis has had a brilliant game here, from the moment he called correctly and was ballsy enough to bat. That bouncer was part of a plan he communicated to Morris last over, though the bowler did well to hold it back initially, then bowl it as quickly as he did. Wicket maiden.

Well done South Africa! They decide to go short at Cook, who opts to take it on. Then at the last second he tries to pull out, by which time the ball is in front of his helmet - it?s brilliantly straight. Cook succeeds only in swatting it down the leg side, where De Kock takes a superb catch. Expect England?s demise to accelerate from here. Updated

24th over: England 72-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 10) Bairstow twists one away against the spin, and it zooms for four through square-leg. Then, though, spooked by that one which flew in Maharaj?s last over, Bairstow presses forward tentatively and inside-edges onto his pad. That did not look secure, but it did the trick. 

12.40pm BST
12:40

23rd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) Root is now inside the dressing room and looking glum; on the bright side, perhaps Cook is playing his way into Test form, and as non-captain.

22nd over: England 68-3 (Cook 42, Bairstow 6) When at the cricket, is it acceptable to drink fizz out of a pint glass? Asking for a friend, though at Lord?s last summer the kid in front cut out the middle man and just used the bottle. Maharaj is on and the ball is spinning, but without many close catchers; his final delivery pitches middle and leg, then pitches right across Bairstow! Dearie me! ?I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, would rather do without, emails Mark Gillespie, quoting me back to myself.?1. How do we know, or why do we assume, that Root is the sole arbiter of who plays and doesn?t? I always had the impression that the team selection was a joint effort between selectors, captain and coach, with the selectors having the biggest say.2. Is the reality not that it?s Moeen, not Dawson, who?s been picked over Rashid? My thinking behind that being that the balance of the team was meant to be a ?control? spinner plus a wicket taking spinner, and that neither Moeen nor Rashid could fulfill the former role? I?m clearly not suggesting that?s worked, by the way, but potentially that was the theory.?I?d say that in the end, the captain gets what he wants, because he?s the one taking the players onto the pitch and it?s pointless giving him a bowler he?d rather not bring on. Moeen is in the team for his batting anyway, no?

12.31pm BST
12:31

21st over: England 66-3 (Cook 41, Bairstow 5) Morris races in and Cook whacks him to square-leg - there?s a man there, so they only run one. On the balcony, Root looks pensive; he?s probably not found much difficult in his life, but here we are. Anyway, Bairstow adds a further single. 

12.26pm BST
12:26

20th over: England 64-3 (Cook 40, Bairstow 4) Cook plays for Olivier?s outswing, driving through cover; WinViz says South Africa are 100% likely to win this match. Cook takes a single and the field is pretty spread for Bairstow; that?s a little strange, given his score of 0 and the 406 more runs England need. Anyway, the first of those issues is quickly resolved via four down the ground. ?I?m not for dropping Ballance,? emails Gareth Fitzgerlad. You just know Andy Flower will demand James Vince get another chance...That being said ? why does Dawson need to be replaced by a spinner? Do we need four seamers and two spinners??I agree that six bowlers are too many, but just can?t see how Ballance is a Test number 3, nor why we need to expend more time investigating. Updated

19th over: England 55-3 (Cook 35, Bairstow 0) There was nothing Root could?ve done about that ball - the tardiness of the swing meant that the shot he played was redundant.

Presumably Maharaj will be on soon, and that will be the next test; in the meantime, Root turns away a single and Cook escapes by missing a pull entirely, while Holding complains that there are too many fielders saving runs and too few catchers. Cook rams the point home by edging four, in the air, to close the over. Updated

17th over: England 50-2 (Cook 31, Root 7) Cook has never scored more than 50 at Trent Bridge; you?d back him to beat that now. Morris is on, bowling to two slips and gully - ?that looks a bit meagre to me,? says Mikey, far more melodically than I can type. root takes a single off the final ball of the over, playing it down into the off side and haring away. ?I think that bowling replacements are better,? emails Matthew Doherty, replying to Neil Harris. ?Rashid and Roland-Jones, with Woakes to return.?I prefer Rashid to Dawson too, but do find it telling that Root, who knows him well, wold rather do without. Roland-Jones is an unknown quantity - we cannot be sure he?ll come in and do the necessary, nor that he?s more likely to than Wood is to improve - and Woakes is out for the series. Updated

16th over: England 49-2 (Cook 31, Root 6) Philander is done for the now, and Olivier has the ball; he?s full and straight first up, so Root drives three to long-off; Philander has to chase to the fence. Small victories, people, small victories. Meanwhile, back in the middle, Olivier gives Cook one on his pads - you know the rest. Or, to put it another way, the next phase of the innings is upon us, and England daren?t lose another wicket. So they add four more instead, Cook onto the front foot to drive down the ground. He is in, and that?s drinks. Updated

Philander has bowled 6.3 overs, of which 33 deliveries have landed in line with the stumps; he now has the best average of any bowler with 50 or more Test wickets. Cook then waves slightly away from his body, but makes decent enough contact, earning four to third man before tucking a couple off his hip. Huge over for England, six from it. Updated

Today, Muslims have realized that it was an illegal structure,"" he explained.Going back in time, the veteran RSS ideologue blamed the dispute on a mistake by Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the subcontinent. TRY BABUR IN COURT ""The Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was destroyed by Babur 400 years ago. Had he not indulged in that act to build such an impure mosque, there would not have been such a predicament today. I would like to appeal to the courts of the land that if someone needs to be tried it should be Babur and his army general Mir Baqi,"" he added.At a time when the RSS backed Muslim Rashtriya Manch is backing the call for a Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, Kumar said that many in the community have stated that they don't want an 'illegal' mosque, especially one that was built on a disputed land.""They (Muslims) have realised that Ram and Khuda are all the same, they are one supreme power. The only difference being that one is abstract and the other takes the form of Lord Ram,"" he added.According to Kumar, the minority community in India now realises that those who are trying to encroach the land forcefully were neither following the principles of Quran nor the Prophet, but were only interested in continuing the stalemate.""They believe that Ram is like their Nabi or Paigambar and most definitely that of their ancestors, thus they want a Ram Temple in Ayodhya to end the dispute forever. They have understood that even though they may be Muslims by faith but in Hindustan their ancestors were all Hindus and their social and domestic customs too were that of the Hindus,"" Kumar said.Also read:Babri Masjid demolition: Supreme Court restores conspiracy charges against LK Advani, MM Joshi, Uma Bharti"

China, who have dominated the event from 1983 up until the last edition, finished second with overall 20 medals including 8 golds. India's 29 medals is also their highest-ever medal haul in the event's history.","In a stunning show of dominance, India clinched five gold to top the medal tally for first time in the history of Asian Athletics Championships, pushing China to second spot, in their most successful campaign in the continental flagship event here today.With today's five gold, one silver and three bronze, India ended the four-day championships on top with their highest ever medal haul of 29 medals (12 gold, 5 silver and 12 bronze).India's best came way back in the 1985 Jakarta edition where they had won 22 medals (10 gold, 5 silver, 7 bronze).China ended this edition on second position with 8 gold, 7 silver and 5 bronze. They won 3 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze today.Japan topped the medal tally in the first five editions of the Asian championships from 1973 to 1981. China's domination began from 1983 at Kuwait City and continued till the previous edition at their home venue in Wuhan two years ago.India snapped China's monopoly this time though their northern neighbours had fielded only a second string team here as their athletes are reserving their best for the upcoming World championships in London next month.The host country, however, suffered a huge setback after 800m runner Archana Yadav was disqualified, after being initially declared as the gold medal winner, for pushing Sri Lankan rival Nimali Waliwarsha Konda from behind near the finishing line. The gold medal was then awarded to Konda and India thus lost a yellow metal in dramatic circumstances.Despite this setback, the Sunday crowd at the Kalinga Stadium were on the edge of their seats as the Indians dished out a superb performance.It was heptathlete Swapna Barman who gave India the first gold of the day (as Archana was qualified) as she collected a total of 5942 points from the seven events.The 20-year-old from Bengal collapsed just after crossing the 800m race, the last of the seven events, and was taken for immediate medical attention.Japan's Meg Hemphill was second with 5883 points while another Indian Purnima Hembram was third with 5798 points.After that Lakhsmanan Govinda took the centrestage as he grabbed his second gold of the championship by winning the men's 10,000m event in 29 minute and 55.87 seconds. Another Indian Gopi Thonkanal was second in 29:58.89.World junior record holder javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra struggled in his initial attempts but got his touch in time to clinch the gold with a final throw of 85.23m.

King Salman also urged citizens to monitor the abuse of power. Notably, one of the videos shows 18 bottles of whisky even though Saudi Arabia forbids alcohol consumption. ","A Saudi prince has been arrested after a video emerged online purporting to show him abusing someone and pointing a rifle at another.King Salman ordered the arrest and interrogation of the prince on Wednesday, a day after short clips were published on YouTube and shared on Twitter showing what appears to be a rifle pointed towards a man bleeding from the head and pleading.One video, viewed more than 760,000 times, shows 18 bottles of Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky on a table and a wad of cash. The sale and consumption of alcohol in Saudi Arabia is forbidden.Another shows a man sitting in a car, bleeding and being cursed at for parking in front of a house, while a further clip shows what appears to be the prince punching and slapping a man sitting on a chair.The clips went viral in Saudi Arabia under an Arabic Twitter hashtag that said ?prince transgresses on citizens?.???? ????? ????? ??? ???????? ???????.????? ?? ??? ???????? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ???????? ???? ?????? ????? .#????_?????_???_??????? pic.twitter.com/ImCsxwOtJeSaudi Arabia?s state TV reported on Wednesday that the king ordered a full investigation into the incidents and the arrest of Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Saud bin Abdulaziz, as well as any associates who appeared in the clips. He ordered that no individual involved in the case be released until a court had issued a ruling in line with the country?s sharia laws.In the order, King Salman urged people to remain vigilant in monitoring any exploitation of status or abuse of power.After he issued the order, a video seen nearly 250,000 times showed the young, low-level prince, dressed in a black T-shirt and grey jogging bottoms, handcuffed and with his feet chained, being escorted into a building by security officers.While many Saudis wrote in support of the king?s decision on Twitter, the outspoken rights activist Moudi Aljohani said the order pointed to how lax the authorities were when it came to royals.The arrest comes a day after state media reported that a woman filmed walking around a historic Saudi fort in a miniskirt and crop top sparked outrage among conservatives for defying the kingdom?s dress code for women, which requires females in public to cover themselves in long, loose robes. The outcry prompted police to detain and question her for several hours before she was released without charge.While Saudi royals are given privileged status in the kingdom, in addition to undisclosed monthly allowances from the state, they are not immune to prosecution. In an extremely rare event, the kingdom executed a prince last October who had fatally shot another man. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of executions in the world.Since ascending to the throne in 2015, King Salman has branded himself a ?decisive? leader. He has fired ministers caught on video being rude or insulting citizens. He also fired a senior royal court official who was filmed slapping a photographer.Before becoming king, Salman served as the governor of the capital, Riyadh, and as defence minister. A leaked 2007 US embassy memo said he ?is often the referee in family disputes?. He also reportedly oversaw a prison for wayward royals in Riyadh."

Lohani, who called the move ""in line with the PM's drive towards simplicity in public life,"" will also carry his own baggage. Henceforth, only MPs and unwell staff can request help with luggage.","In the last few months, India?s pervasive culture of privilege has got a sound beating: In March, Ravindra Gaikwad, an MP, hit a 60-year-old Air India (AI) employee with a slipper and soon found himself on a ?no-fly? list. Then in April, the Cabinet banned red beacons on cars. And Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that there are no VIPs, every Indian is a very important person.On Wednesday, Air India (AI) scrapped one more privilege, this time an in-house one. Air India chairman and managing director Ashwani Lohani asked the staff to carry their hand baggage on their own and not use porters as has been the practice so far. Air India has a subsidiary called AI-SATS, a ground handling agency, which provides end-to-end services such as passenger and baggage handling. Apart from this, some people are reserved to assist VIPs and airline staff. They are called porters and carry the luggage of the ?VIP? passenger from the entry gate to the boarding point. But now only VIPs will continue to use the services of porters, the airline staff will be discouraged to use it. ?Even CMD will not use the porter service,? the airline said.While the move appreciable, the change is cosmetic. The move would have got a higher rating if this privilege was taken away from VIPs too. While such changes are fine and make for good optics, there are so many things that the AI needs to fix and, hopefully, those will also get adequate attention. Take for example, the airline?s rating and public perception. In January, flight data firm FlightStats marked AI as the third worst-performing airline in the world. The Portland-headquartered firm?s survey highlighted issues over cabins, service quality, and flight delays. Though Air India disagreed with the report, such reports do impact public perception and eventually bookings. It is important to manage perceptions and AI has to invest time, effort and money into it apart from doing away with perks and privileges extended to staff.  Then its finances. As a columnist pointed out last week, the organisation has consistently incurred losses and is severely debt-ridden despite equity infusion of around Rs 25,000 crore since 2012. More damaging was the Comptroller and Auditor General?s performance audit report of the airline, which was tabled in Parliament in March. The report said inefficiencies in the company may mean that a lot more of public money will be needed to keep the Maharaja afloat.  "

Claiming that Kasab was just a 'pawn', Musharraf added, ""I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for."" He further said that India did wrong to approach the ICJ. ","Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on Friday said that Kulbhushan Jadhav is a bigger terrorist than Ajmal Kasab, one of the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which more than 150 people were killed. Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court in April this year on charges of espionage. Pakistan alleges that Jadhav is a Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agent and is responsible for fomenting unrest in Balochistan, the troubled Pakistani region where Islamabad has long accused RAW of promoting terrorism.In an interview to Pakistan's ARY News, Musharraf drew parallels between Jadhav and Kasab, who was hanged to death in India for his role in the Mumbai attacks. Musharraf said Kasab was just a ""pawn"" while Jadhav is responsible for getting ""dozens of people"" to carry out terrorist activities. ""Who is a bigger culprit (between Jadhav and Kasab),"" Musharraf rhetorically asked, before saying, ""Obviously it is Jadhav."" ""I don't even know how many people's deaths Jadhav is responsible for,"" Musharraf added.The former Pakistani army chief also slammed his country for appearing in the International Court of Justice, which this week put a stay on Jadhav's death sentence. ""It was wrong that India went to the ICJ,"" Musharraf said, adding, ""Pakistan should not have gone (to the ICJ"". Issues of espionage and sabotage are Pakistan's internal matters, Musharraf added, saying no one has the authority to advise his country on these issues. He also went on to indicate that world bodies like the United Nations and the International Court of Justice don't have any real power. Directives issued by these world bodies are ignored by some countries, Musharraf said when asked whether Pakistan could have realistically avoided sending a team to the ICJ to defend against India's claim. Musharraf went on to cite the example of the United States executing two German nationals in 1999 despite an ICJ provisional ruling putting a stay on the death penalty awarded to the two. THE KULBHUSHAN JADHAV ISSUE In April this year, Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa confirmed the death sentence handed to Kulbhushan Jadhav, accused of spying.India, which slammed Jadhav's trial as 'farcical', said that Jadhav is not a spy and that he is a former Indian Navy officer-turned businessman who was kidnapped in Iran and taken to Pakistan. Contending that Islamabad had violated the Vienna Convention by not providing New Delhi consular access to Jadhav, India filed a petition at The Hague, Netherlands-based ICJ. This week, the World Court, allowing India's plea, asked Pakistan not to execute Jadhav until the ICJ has had the time to hear the matter in full and arrive at a final verdict.ALSO READ: How Pakistani media reported ICJ stay on Kulbhushan Jadhav's death sentence"

He also said that he will meet the Chief Minister and discuss ways to provide tax relaxation to various religious places like temples.Surprisingly, the notice papers were directly addressed to the gods or their temples. The municipal council soon became a laughing stock leaving people to wonder if gods also paid taxes.City's Sanyas Ashram was sent a property tax bill of Rs 2.77 lakh. Goddess Durga was also sent a notice to pay a property tax of Rs 1.10 lakh. It did not stop there as a cremation ground was also sent a property tax bill."

He said GST will check evasion of indirect taxes and reduce unaccounted money in the system. ""Pay taxes or get out,"" the Godrej Group chairman said.An ideal GST will give us a benefit of 100 per cent; the present system will still give us a benefit of 80 if not 100, said Adi Godrej, allaying fears that GST will hit entrepreneurs.On fears of Inspector Raj coming back post-demonetisation, Deepak Parekh said cracking down on people holding black money is the right thing to do and such people ought to be penalised.Adi Godrej, however, differed and said that whenever a government has tried to control things, it has failed.Godrej said that while the objectives of the exercise were good but they should be achieved not just by cracking down but through incentivisation. ""Whenever we have reduced the rate of taxes, we have had great success,"" he said. On the government's November 8, 2016 decision to demonetise high-value currency, Deepak Parekh backed it while Adi Godrej said he would have been more cautious if he were to make a similar decision.On the ease of doing business, both Deepak Parekh and Adi Godrej said India still has a long way to go. The reforms made at the Central level have not yet percolated to the state, said Deepak Parekh, asking states to shape up."

","A clash of national cultures and an inability to understand each other?s languages threatens to make the merged Air France-KLM group of airlines unmanageable, according to a leaked internal company report.French staff in the Franco-Dutch company complain their colleagues from the Netherlands are money-grubbing, while the Dutch regard the Air France staff as aloof, according to the report.Among the petty grievances, there is irritation that a KLM employee working in Paris is charged ?10 for lunch in the canteen, while an Air France colleague pays only ?4.Such is the state of relations, according to the 100-page report, compiled by unions acting for staff within the group, that there are fears for the company?s future. ?One questions whether the alliance can survive given the long-standing mutual incomprehension between the Dutch and French camps within the group,? one researcher was quoted as writing.The embarrassing insight into the company emerged after a French and a Dutch researcher spoke to nearly 50 managers at the airline, which was formed 13 years ago through the merger of its constituent airlines.?The French have the impression that the Dutch think only of money and are always ready to fight for profit. They are not afraid of anything,? the researchers reported.?The Dutch think that the French are attached to a hierarchy and political interests which are not necessarily the same as the interests of the company ?

The crocodile ancestor from the late Jurassic era is believed to be two metres long based on the size of the eggs. The eggs found during excavations of a dinosaur nest near Lisbon extends knowledge of eggs by four crore years, said a palaeontologist.","London, Mar 10 (PTI) The worlds oldest known crocodile eggs laid some 152 million years ago have been discovered in the cliffs of Portugal. The remarkably well preserved eggs give an insight into the ""mother croc"" that laid them, researchers said. They are similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles, suggesting crocodile eggs have changed little in shape in the last 150 million years. Palaeontologists say the prehistoric crocodile ancestor would have spanned two metres, based on the size of the larger eggs. ""The fact that they are from the Late Jurassic makes these eggs the oldest crocodilian eggs known so far,"" said Joao Russo of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. ""This new discovery from Portugal extends the knowledge of this type of egg by approximately 40 million years,"" said Russo. Crocodilians arose some 200 million years ago, when they prowled the land with early dinosaurs. "

""Indrani had introduced Sheena and Mikhail as her siblings to everyone?Peter was clearly not involved, nor was he aware of any crime allegedly perpetrated by Indrani,"" he added.n","In defense of his father and former television head honcho Peter Mukerjea, Rahul Mukerjea, a prime witness of the case today wrote an open letter defending his father again.Tweeting the letter, Rahul reiterated that his dad believed every word his wife told him.Although this is not the first time he has come out in his father's defense while putting the entire blame of Sheena's murder in 2012 on Indrani, the timing of this longish letter assumes importance.The charges against Peter, Indrani and her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna were filed this month. They have been charged with murder and the trial is set to start in four days.Following is the letter that he has set out in the social media.To all concerned, Ref: Sheena Bora Now that the investigation is complete and the trial is starting, it is (cont) https://t.co/qhe8WKnapcTo all concerned,Ref: Sheena BoraNow that the investigation is complete and the trial is starting, it is of utmost importance to know the correct context and understand the situation correctly - especially with the misinformation carried by sections of the media.The narrative that points to Peter's involvement, is absolutely incorrect and has very unfairly been publicised as the only narrative, and without a fair and balanced counter.In the interests of justice and fairness, it is important to share this information.So here is the correct context;Indrani had introduced Sheena and Mikhail as her siblings to everyone, including Peter.Indrani obviously didn't want it to be revealed that they were her children.Initially when she met Sheena and Mikhail, after they had made contact with her upon seeing her in the news, she instructed them to maintain her lie, or she wouldn't help them in any way. This fact was always kept secret from Peter..that they were her kids. But..when Sheena and I tried to tell Peter about this lie, he asked Indrani and she strongly refuted it, insisting this was not true and that they were in fact her siblings and not her children.Indrani would have then been extremely angry with Sheena for disobeying her most important instruction and undermining her.Peter didn't know the truth of Sheena and Indrani's relationship. If Peter asked Indrani whether there was any truth to these apparent revelations, she only denied it and claimed they were sisters.Evidently, there was no financial motive.Whatever Indrani may have done, was for her own personal reasons.Peter was clearly not involved.Peter was never allowed, by Indrani, to visit Guwahati to meet her parents, obviously, as that would have led to him becoming aware of the truth about Indrani's past and her kids. Something which she was seemingly trying to hide.Indrani had given him the story that Sheena had contacted her with a view to leaving our relationship and wanted money and help to do that (this was not true). But trusting his wife, Peter believed it. Indrani also backed up that story by sending sms messages from Sheena's phone to Peter, stating the same.. That is why he was so sure that she must be fine.Peter's only comment to Indrani on hearing that Sheena wanted to leave, was that 'if Sheena wants to leave Rahul, then she really ought to tell him in some form or another.. can't just go without saying anything.' (as that would have been very hard for me or anyone to deal with). Hence the text msgs sent from Sheena's phone by Indrani.Indrani has been cunning and manipulative and with tragic results, very convincing. She was able to make Peter believe her lies so that she could maintain her deception, and carry on doing what she really intended.He certainly did NOT know what lndrani was upto before, during, or after, with regard to any crime.Emails and recordings MUST be seen in the correct context. He believed what Indrani had told him that Sheena was indeed fine and didn't want to be in touch. And therefore on that basis, he was supporting Indrani's claims that Sheena was ok. NOT a case of misleading because of complicity in any crime..but a situation where he really believed that Sheena was okay because his wife was assuring him of such - and he was trying to tell me the same.In early 2012 when Sheena contacted Indrani with a view to clearing the air, Indrani had told Peter that Sheena had in fact contacted her with a view to leaving the relationship and wanted Indrani's help to do that (Peter was lied to). Therefore, any of Peter's subsequent reassurances given to me that Sheena was fine, or must be fine, were as a result of him believing what he had been told, which Indrani also corroborated to make believable by sending a couple of SMS messages to herself and to Peter, from Sheena's phone, claiming the same.Any and all who inquired about Sheena, were peddled this same story by Indrani and were equally convinced - it was not just Peter who believed her.Peter was clearly not involved, nor was he aware of any crime allegedly perpetrated by Indrani, despite claims to the contrary.These important circumstances, which to date have not been pointed out, very clearly show that Peter was NOT 'in the know' nor was he involved in the crime.Hence, charges against Peter ought to be dropped."

However, customers cannot demand that workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, it stated. Notably, this is the EU court's first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work.","Politicians on the right have welcomed a ruling by the EU?s highest court that allows companies to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols, as a long-awaited legal judgment ricocheted into the French and Dutch election campaigns.In its first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, the European court of justice in Luxembourg ruled the garments could be banned, but only as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols.Nor can customers simply demand workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, the court ruled on Tuesday.The long-awaited ruling came on the eve of Dutch elections, where Muslim immigration has been a contentious issue. In France, where the race to succeed President FranÃ§ois Hollande remains wide open, politicians on the right seized on the issue.FranÃ§ois Fillon, the presidential candidate who has taken a hardline stance on Islam?s place in France, welcomed the judgment. On the day he was placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds he said in a statement that it was ?an immense relief, not just for thousands of companies but also for their workers?. He said the ruling would be ?a factor in cohesion and social peace?, particularly in France.Gilbert Collard, an MP for the Rassemblement Bleu Marine, which supports Marine Le Pen?s Front National, claimed the ruling was an endorsement. ?Even the ECJ votes Marine,? he wrote on Twitter.In Germany, the rightwing populist party, Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland, also welcomed the ruling: ?The ECJ?s ruling sends out the right signal, especially for Germany,? said the AfD?s Berlin leader, Georg Pazderski. ?Of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.?The ECJ issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from France and Belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.?An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,? the court said.It ruled that a company?s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.The first case was referred to the ECJ by the Belgian courts. Samira Achbita had been a receptionist for the Belgian branch of G4S, the London-listed outsourcing and security company when, after three years at the firm she decided she wanted to start wearing a headscarf at work for religious reasons. Achbita was fired in June 2006 for refusing to take off her scarf. The company said she had broken unwritten rules prohibiting religious symbols.In the second case, Asma Bougnaoui, a design engineer, was fired from an IT consultancy firm, Micropole, after a customer complained that his staff had been ?embarrassed? by her headscarf while she was on their premises to give advice. She had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company?s customers.In Achbita?s case the ECJ followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.?The court of justice finds that G4S?s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction. The rule thus treats all employees to the undertaking in the same way, notably by requiring them, generally and without any differentiation, to dress neutrally.?In Bougnaoui?s case the court?s adviser had ruled that she had suffered discrimination. She had been ?professionally competent? and sacked only because she had refused to remove her headscarf, the advocate general advised.The court upheld this view with a less ringing endorsement. It said customers? wishes not to be served by a worker wearing a headscarf did not give companies a get-out clause from EU anti-discrimination law. ?However, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer?s services provided by a worker wearing an Islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.?The ECJ did not rule on whether Bougnaoui?s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the French court to determine.The German broadsheet SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how German courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since 2002 had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds. The ruling, which is more nuanced than a straightforward ban, could sow confusion about which religious symbols can be worn at work. Some legal experts said it seemed to cut against a ruling from the European court of human rights (ECHR) that allowed crosses to be worn.Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Essex University, said the latest ECJ ruling looked awkward when set against the ECHR judgment that wearing religious symbols is ?sometimes an employee?s right to manifest freedom of religion?. He said the ECJ had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.The ECHR is the high court of the 47-member Council of Europe and not part of the EU. Traditionally, the EU court in Luxembourg confined itself to evening out distortions in Europe?s single market, but its remit has grown as EU law has expanded.The ruling prompted dismay from some religious groups. The Conference of European Rabbis, which comprises 700 Jewish leaders across Europe, said Europe was sending a clear message that its faith communities were no longer welcome. Referring to the rise of racially motivated incidents, Pinchas Goldschmidt, the group?s president, called on politicians to ensure Europe did not isolate religious minorities.Maryam H?madoun at the Open Society Justice Initiative said she was disappointed by the ruling, which she described as discrimination against people who chose to show their religion in their dress. ?It will lead to Muslim women being discriminated in the workplace, but also Jewish men who wear kippas, Sikh men who wear turbans, people who wear crosses. It affects all of them, but disproportionately Muslim women,? she said.Stephen Evans, the campaigns director at the National Secular Society in the UK, said: ?Where a ban on employees wearing religious or political symbols is founded on a general company rule of religious and political neutrality, and where that rule is applied equally to all, it can?t be realistically argued that that this constitutes ?less favourable treatment?.?Religious and political neutrality is a perfectly reasonable aim and, where businesses and organisations wish to present themselves in such a way, this ruling demonstrates that this approach is perfectly consistent with equality and human rights law.?Angelique Chrisafis contributed to this report"

The accused chased the man even after he scaled a railway station wall. They were arrested by police who spotted them beating up the victim on the railway platform. ","In an extreme form of street crime, three men chased a 20-year-old youth for several hundred metres before beating him to death on the main platform of the busy Adarsh Nagar railway station in north Delhi.At least 50 passengers and vendors stood and watched as the three men rained punches and kicks on Rahul?s head, chest and private parts. The three could have easily gotten away after the murder but for a head constable who decided to take on the killers and nab them.While Rahul could never live to tell his story, the killers have claimed in police interrogation that they were chasing Rahul as he had allegedly snatched Rs20,000 from one of their hands. No cash, however, was found on Rahul?s body or pockets after his murder.A resident of Jahangirpuri in north Delhi, Rahul worked as a loader at the wholesale vegetable market in Azadpur. His job bringing in very little money, he was in desperate need of money recently. On Thursday afternoon, he met a trucker friend in the vegetable market.?The trucker was carrying Rs 20,000 with him and Rahul saw that. He requested that the money be lent to him for a few days, but the truck driver refused. Suddenly, Rahul snatched the money and ran,? said an investigator quoting the killers.Road rage to fight over food bill: Why Delhi is on short fuseThe trucker allegedly called on his two friends, who too work as loaders, as they began chasing Rahul. What really led to the chase and the murder is entirely based on the claims of the suspects. In any case, Rahul sprinted from the market with the three men close on his heels. ?He ran for several hundred metres before scaling a wall to land at the premises of the Adarsh Nagar railway station. He must have thought he was safe amid a large gathering of train passengers, but he was not spared,? said an investigator.Rahul found himself surrounded by the men on platform number 1, barely a few metres from the station?s main entrance. ?The men did not have any weapons on them. They thrashed him. Rahul initially tried to fight back, but collapsed after receiving a few blows,? said a railway staffer, who was at the platform at that time.Not a single passenger dared to take on the killers. But one of them managed to alert a policeman who was deployed at the station. He and a home guard chased the killers and caught them from the station premises itself. They have been arrested and identified as Ravi, Lalit and Rajender.Police have said they are awaiting the autopsy report to confirm blow to which body part led to Rahul?s death. The police continue to investigate if Rahul had actually snatched the money or there was some other motive behind the murder."

The IIM Bill pushes for the declaration of 20 existing IIMs as institutions of national importance. ""It is difficult to run IIMs from here (New Delhi),"" HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said.","The Lok Sabha allowed the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) to award degrees to students, passing a bill on Friday that grants greater autonomy to the country?s premier business schools.The bill now goes to the Rajya Sabha for clearance.There are 20 IIMs in the country but none can offer degrees as the institutes are registered as societies under an 1860 law. Unless an institute is established by an act enacted in Parliament or as a university, it cannot grant degrees.The Indian Institute of Management Bill, 2017, alters the top-rated business school?s status, which will enable the institute to award degrees such as MBA and PhD, instead of PGDM and fellowships.Human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar said the aim is to remove government interference in IIMs. ?We should learn to trust our institutions ... joint secretaries running IIMs from Delhi is not desirable.?The bill pushes for IIMs to be declared institutions of national importance. And it has provisions for appointing members in each of the IIM?s board of governors through a transparent process, limiting the HRD minister?s role. The government will have a lone representative in each board. The post of IIM visitor ? currently, the country?s President ? will be abolished.In a rare gesture, opposition parties congratulated Javadekar for bringing the bill. Former junior HRD minister Shashi Tharoor of the Congress praised the steps, but cautioned that handing the IIM boards full control to decide fees could lead to marginalization of poor students. He took the occasion to announce his unhappiness over the government removing former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi?s name from the Shillong IIM. He said it was a ?petty? act.Tharoor also objected to the government?s proposal to rename IIM Calcutta as IIM Kolkata. He said the institute will lose its cultivated brand value as IIM-C and the name-change would create confusion as well because an IIM-K exists in Kozhikode. In response, Javadekar said no eligible and meritorious student will be denied admission to IIMs for lack of money. The comptroller and auditor general will check IIM account books since these run on taxpayer?s money, he added.Also, he said: ?There is no provision of giving names to IIMs. All are IIMs. So the question of changing names does not arise,? he said.Trinamool Congress leader Saugata Roy, who is also an educationist, welcomed the bill and requested the government lower the fee of IIMs to avoid deterring students.CPM parliamentarian MB Rajesh also spoke about the high fee in IIMs. He said the institutes should not use the autonomous status to make money."

However, the petitioners claim the outlets are located over 500 metres away from highways.","The Bombay High Court today was informed by the Maharashtra government pleader that it cannot find the notification classifying roads as state highways and other roads. The reason Maharashtra government is looking for this notification is because a bunch of petitions have been filed by liquor vendors and restaurant owners claiming that the excise department is now not renewing their licenses to sell or serve liquor as the department claims they are located on the highways.It was in December last year that the Supreme Court in its landmark judgment of State of Tamil Nadu V/s. K. Balu and others had directed for not issuing license to liquor shops and permit rooms within distance of 500 mtrs form the national and state highways.Â  By the said judgment the apex court had also directed for not renewing license of existing shops and for not issuing new license for such shops after 31st March, 2017 along national and state highways. The petitioners claim that the bars, restaurants and wine shops are neither situated on a national highway nor on a state highway, but is located in by-lanes of the city, more than 500 meters from the highways.Â  For example, one of the petitioners is King Wines, which is located in the heart of Kolhapur city. The petitioner submits that recently, their licenses were renewed for this year on accepting requisite license fees by the district collector and superintendent of state excise in Kolhapur. However, the same authorities, after renewal, directed the wine shop owner to forthwith, stop all their business owing to Supreme Court's order. Â Thus, during the last hearing on May 31st the division bench of Justice B P Colabawalla and Justice A M Badar had asked for the notification. Advocate Shrikrishna Ganbavale who is appearing for the petitioners explained, ""There has to be a notification from state government that this road or that road is a national highway or a state highway. Without that the state government cannot arbitrarily close down business establishments. That is why they have been asked to show the notifications.""The court has granted the state government time till Monday to get these notifications and has even asked the advocate general of Maharashtra to appear before them."

He unabashedly even sent her a lewd video on the company's official Gmail chat, the FIR alleges. 'Mr. Pandey got so bold as to send me a lewd video over the official Gmail chat, in which the words were ""aapnu jeans dheeli karo""', reads the FIR. ScoopWhoop's inactionWhen the complainant, took up the matter with ScoopWhoop co-founder Sriparna Tikekar, she assured her that such behaviour would not be repeated. However, apparently she did not take any action against Pandey. The former senior executive did not stop raising the issue with the company's founders even after realising that it had no repercussions for Pandey. She was instead publicly humilated and was allegedly forced to work in close quarters with Pandey. If she was refused, she was ""reprimanded and humiliated"".Suparn Pandey used to show up to work drunk and would try to touch the complainant. She decided to quit after Pandey crossed all limits. 'Mr. Pandey approached me after the meeting, between 8-9:30PM, when I was alone at my work desk and asked me to be less ""aggressive"" in my dealings with other people and learn to ""pour some sugar on it."" That after that, he then got up, kissed my forehead and walked away,' the complainant recounts in the FIR .Â  She was allegedly dissuaded from lodging a formal complaint and the co-founders threatened to hurt her career and defame her publicly. Following a series of complaints and threats, she resigned from ScoopWhoop. "

Terming the condition of such schools ?pitiable? and ?ridiculous?, a bench of justices RM Savant and Sadhana Jadhav said that the state had wasted time by constituting one committee after another but and had taken no steps to improve the infrastructure and facilities of these schools.The bench directed the secretary of the state tribal welfare department to file within three weeks a compliance report, including remedial measures, to improve the conditions of ashram schools in Maharashtra. It directed the state to provide basic facilities such as clean drinking water, mattresses, healthcare, toilets etc.These schools, meant primarily for children from tribal areas in the state, battle neglect and government apathy. The direction came while the bench was hearing a public interest litigation claiming that 793 children had died over the past 10 years in various ashram schools. The reasons for these deaths ranged from snake bites to fevers to other illnesses. ?This is really ridiculous. The state government is obligated to provide basic facilities. It is the government?s duty and responsibility. Except passing hollow resolutions, the government has done little to improve the condition,? the bench said. ?Immediate action must be taken to provide basic facilities such as clean and adequate number of toilets, drinking water facility, medical treatment, beddings and mattresses in hostels etc. The government must also appoint a female warden in each school that has girl students,? the bench said.

Reinstating his flying privileges, the FIA, however, said its colleagues must be treated with the respect that they deserve. Notably, the ban was imposed after Gaikwad repeatedly thrashed an Air India staffer.","A day after Air India lifted the ban on Ravindra Gaikwad, the Federation of Indian Airlines, a group of major private carriers, also revoked its ban on the Shiv Sena Member of Parliament. Gaikwad had been barred from flying by Air India and the FIA after he repeatedly hit an Air India staffer during an argument on March 23. On Friday, the Osmanabad MP wrote to the Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju expressing 'regret' for the incident, which grabbed national headlines.Following his Parliament statement, the Minsitry of Civil Aviation ordered the national carrier to lift its fly ban on Gaikwad. Â  In a statement, Ujjawal Dey, the associate director of the FIA, said, ""Consequent to Air India restoring flying privileges to Mr. Gaikwad after being satisfied with the statement given by the Member of Parliament, the FIA member airlines are also restoring the flying privileges to Mr. Gaikwad under the assurance that our assets and colleagues shall be accorded the respect that they deserve for the hard work that they put in every day."" The FIA counts Jet Airways, Go Air, IndiGo, JetLite and SpiceJet among its members. With this, Gaikwad, who travelled to Mumbai today morning in the Rajdhani Express, is free to fly any route, any airline. Vistara remains the only private airline that hasn't yet clarified whether they will fly the controversial MP or not.THE INCIDENTOn March 23, Gaikwad reached Delhi in an Air India flight and got into an argument with airline employees while his plane was still on the tarmac. The MP was angry over not being allocated a business class seat despite having a ticket for the same. Gaikwad claimed Air India did not inform at the time of booking that his flight would not have business class seating. Minutes into the argument, Gaikwad started slapping a 60-year-old Air India staffer with his slippers. The airline registered a case with the Delhi Police and proceeded to impose a fly ban on him the next day. The following two weeks saw much controversy with private airliners joining Air India's stand even as the brazen MP refused to apologise. His party, Shiv Sena, too backed him, calling the decision of the airlines to bar him from flying unfair."

Anmol Sharma,07-2017,"Froome wins 4th Tour de France, finishes race in under 87hrs",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/23/chris-froome-wins-fourth-tour-de-france?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"British cyclist Chris Froome won his third consecutive and fourth overall Tour de France, finishing the race in 86 hours 20 minutes 55 seconds in Paris on Sunday. The 32-year-old rider, who finished the event with a 54-second lead, has moved within one win of the all-time record. The 3,540-km 23-day long Grand Tour, featured a total of 198 riders.","The French capital was in lockdown on Sunday, with extra rings of security around the Champs ÃlysÃ©es, which had been turned into a vast sterile zone as a foretaste of what awaits the French capital when the Olympics arrive in either 2024 or 2028. In an understandable attempt to put Paris on display as never before, the race was routed through the Grand Palais with the riders racing under the famous glass roof, originally erected in 1897 for the universal exposition of the turn of the century.For Chris Froome it was but a novel diversion en route to confirmation of his fourth Tour de France victory. The Team Sky rider crossed the line in the bunch behind the stage winner, Dylan Groenewegen, to win the yellow jersey by 54 seconds from Rigoberto UrÃ¡n.Bike races have been sent through buildings before ? there is a legendary kermis in Belgium which went through a bar full of drinkers and cyclo-cross races are sometimes sent through beer tents ? but this was about more than merely upping the returns in adjacent brasseries. Coming as it did the day after the start and finish in Marseille?s Stade VÃ©lodrome ? albeit far from full due to the fact that few ticket holders wanted to stay in the stands all day ? the Grand Palais detour was further evidence that the Tour is constantly looking for new ways to reinvent itself, and a reminder that it increasingly sees itself as a way of showing this multifaceted country to the world.Lockdown could serve as a metaphor for the Tour as a whole, given the way the overall battle had panned out since the race left DÃ¼sseldorf 22 days ago. In four of the five previous Tours, Team Sky had brought their cycling version of catenaccio to bear on the race, but they had never done so to the extent they managed this year, with the yellow jersey only eluding them for two days once Geraint Thomas had won the opening time trial. For kilometre after kilometre the white train ground out the pace on the front, up hill and down dale, at times lining out the entire race when on paper it was not strictly necessary.As Froome?s fourth win loomed large, it was inevitable that at least one French newspaper ? Le Figaro, as it turned out ? would describe the Tour winner using Antoine Blondin?s sublime pun, ?gÃ©rant de la route? ? a wordplay on the verb gÃ©rer, meaning to manage or regulate, and the hoary French cliche for the Tour riders, les gÃ©ants de la route. An English translation might be accountancy on wheels. Or to paraphrase Geoff Nicholson, hoarding seconds like supermarket discount coupons.Froome himself said that this was his and Team Sky?s chosen approach. ?We knew in DÃ¼sseldorf that it would be tight. It was always the tactic to ride this as a three-week race, not to go out on one day to blow it up, smash it for the stage win ? just chipping away every stage to make sure there were no massive losses. That?s normal when on a bad day in the mountains you can lose minutes. It?s been about doing it in the most conservative and efficient manner. That?s what Grand Tour racing is.?Compare and contrast with Dan Martin, who treats the key days like individual one-day classics, but ? before you veer too strongly towards espousing Martin?s philosophy ? bear in mind who actually won.Fourth Tour wins are the penultimate step to cycling greatness, but often do little to warm the soul at the time. This could certainly be said of the three that I can personally recall: Lance Armstrong in 2002 (with the usual proviso that it has been struck off), Miguel Indurain in 1994 and Bernard Hinault in 1982. They seem to be ones for the record books rather than the heart, but they can be turned by an individual?s approach. Hinault, in 1982, faced the same issue that confronted Froome as he approached Paris on Sunday: a Tour without a stage win, and the consequent carps about a lack of panache.The Badger?s response was to win the bunch sprint on the Champs ÃlysÃ©es, but this is not one from the Froome copybook. Having said that, Froome?s great strength over his four victories is his ability to adapt to whatever the Tour organisers present to him, and whatever fate decrees. 2013 had a wealth of time trialling and an immensely tough finale in the Alps; in 2015 there were cobbles and a team time trial but barely any individual time trials, while in 2016 there was more time trialling and a downhill finale into Morzine, in teeming rain, not to mention the run up Mont Ventoux.He is a champion who has versatility and grit, if not charisma or popularity. His approach to the latter is summed up by his answer to the question of why he felt he did not need to give press conferences on the rest days. ?Rest days are meant to be rest days and a big press conference is not good for recovery. I felt it helped me being able to switch off.? If Froome chooses to pursue a ?marginal gain? by hiding from a 15-minute discussion with the people whose job it is to present his personality to the world, he can hardly complain if his personality is not understood or appreciated for what it is. This is the Team Sky approach of winning at all costs; in this case the cost has to be borne by him.For the neutral there was much unbridled bike racing by individuals of character and panache to be savoured through the 2017 Tour, with the unfortunate proviso that very little of it actually involved the battle for the overall title. Some days will live in the memory: the moyenne montagne stage to Les Rousses won by Lilian Calmejane, Steve Cummings?s attempt to take the stage to Peyragudes, Sunweb?s battle with Quick-Step on the road to Romans-sur-IsÃ¨re on behalf of their sprinters Mike Matthews and Marcel Kittel, Alberto Contador?s raging against the dying of the light en route to Foix and Serre-Chevalier, and Edvald Boasson Hagen?s cunning on Friday at Salon-de-Provence.Two stages can be seen as key episodes in the picaresque three-week soap opera: the DÃ¼sseldorf time trial, because of the time gained by Froome, and the message it sent about the probable outcome in Marseille three weeks later, and ChambÃ©ry, with the crash that eliminated Richie Porte ? whose BMC team looked second strongest to Sky ? and which put Daniel Martin physically and temporally on the back foot for the rest of the race.What of the opposition? They fell upon a Froome who was probably not as strong as in the past, but who had the nous, the sangfroid and the team to get him cycling?s greatest prize. ?At the moment we?re not ready to beat Chris Froome. Most teams aren?t,? said Orica-Scott?s director sportive Matt White, who placed a Yates brother in the top 10 and the white jersey of best under-25 for the second year running.?We?ll be coming back with a leader next year to try to beat Chris. Everyone is beatable. The model that Sky run and how they race makes it difficult. I?ve no idea what it?s a sign of but this year in general we haven?t seen him at the level of the past. That level was still good enough to win the Tour de France, and that shows the class of the man.?"

He added that China's economy was largely dependent on Indian markets and boycotting their goods would teach neighbours a lesson. He further said China was acting like a 'goonda' and is disturbed by India's growing power.,"Here's yet another call to boycott Chinese goods in India, this time from the ruling BJP. In the wake of escalating tension along the India-China border, Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Friday appealed to Delhi's traders to refuse selling Chinese products as that will be a big blow to the Chinese economy.He said, notwithstanding China's military, its economy was largely dependent on Indian markets and traders here should boycott selling their products to teach the neighbour a lesson. Tiwari was interacting with traders of Khan Market and Hauz Khas Village on Friday evening, regarding their concerns on the roll out of GST.Traders' association of Khan Market said it would ask traders not to sell Chinese goods during the upcoming festive season. ""We will write to the traders of Khan Market to boycott Chinese goods. After all it is in the national interest,"" said Sanjiv Mehra, President of Khan Market Traders' Association.CHINA FRUSTRATED: TIWARIReferring to China in the context of GST, Tiwari said it was troubled by the economic reform in India and the tension on border was an outcome of China's frustration.""China is acting like a goonda. It is disturbed by India's growing economic and strategic power. Since India is the biggest market of Chinese goods, we must stop using them. This will affect China's economy the most,"" Tiwari said.Last year, too, there came up a campaign to boycott Chinese goods in the wake of ""Make in India"", which escalated after the Uri attack, ahead of Diwali. However, Tiwari noted that last year traders had already stocked large quantities of Chinese products such as firecrackers and lights, and hence feared heavy losses.""This year you (traders) should rethink purchasing Chinese products ahead of the festive season,"" he appealed.Another trader of Khan Market said that he supported the call for boycotting Chinese goods, but sought from the government a hassle-free trading environment within the country so that their business was not affected. He also suggested that awareness should be created among the public about the benefits of GST.About the concerns over GST, Tiwari assured the traders that government would not harass citizens. He said the grievances will be addressed soon.Also Read:Why China will mend ways to defuse border tension and not boast of 1962"

Pragya Swastik,06-2017,Sting operation reveals Apple staff misled users on Error 53,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/05/apple-error-53-sting-operation-caught-staff-misleading-customers-court-documents-allege#img-1 ,"A sting operation against Apple by Australian consumer watchdog has revealed the staff repeatedly misled iPhone customers over 'error 53' malfunction. The watchdog said the staff wrongly denied consumers free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer. Between 2014 and 2016, 'error 53' malfunction rendered many iPhones and iPads useless.","Australia?s consumer watchdog carried out a sting operation against Apple which it says caught staff repeatedly misleading iPhone customers about their legal rights to a free repair or replacement after a so-called ?error 53? malfunction, court documents reveal.Australian authorities lodged a high-profile case against Apple this year, after iPhone and iPad customers experienced a malfunction that rendered phones useless if it detects that a repair has been carried out by a non-Apple technician. The fault occurred between late 2014 until early last year.The case, set to go to trial in mid-December, accuses Apple of wrongly telling customers they were not entitled to free replacements or repair if they had taken their devices to an unauthorised third-party repairer.That advice was allegedly given even where the repair ? a screen replacement, for example ? was not related to the fault.Apple has so far chosen to remain silent about the case brought by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). But court documents obtained by Guardian Australia show the company has denied the ACCC?s allegations, saying it did not mislead or cause any harm to its Australian customers.The documents also show how the ACCC used undercover methods to investigate Apple. Investigators, posing as iPhone customers, called all 13 Apple retailers across Australia in June last year.They told Apple staff their iPhone speakers had stopped working after screens were replaced by a third party.Apple?s response was the same in each of the 13 calls, the ACCC alleges.?In each call, Apple Australia represented to the ACCC caller that no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, remedy the defective speaker at no cost under the [Australian consumer law] if the screen of the iPhone had been replaced by someone other than Apple Australia or an Apple-authorised service provider,? the ACCC?s court claim alleged. Error 53 generally occurred after a user tried to update their phone to iOS 8 or iOS 9, and affected about one in every 1,000 phones supplied by Apple or its resellers between September 2014 and February 2016. Australian consumer law clearly protects the right of a customer to a replacement or free repair if the product is faulty or of unacceptable quality. The ACCC has also alleged information on Apple US?s website misled customers about their rights. The website told users experiencing error 53 that: ?If the screen or any other part on your iPhone or iPad was replaced somewhere else, contact Apple Support about pricing information for out-of-warranty repairs.?Apple, in response, said the undercover calls made by the ACCC cannot be considered as breaches because consumer law does not exist in ?hypothetical circumstances?. The company said that real customers who had called the store would have received other information from Apple that informed them of their rights under consumer law. Apple denied the message on its US website was an ?express representation? that consumers were not entitled to a free replacement or repair. Apple said the website was referring only to the conditions of the company?s own limited warranty, which existed in addition to a customer?s statutory rights. It was only one part of the communications between the company and its customers over error 53, the company said, and must be interpreted in the broader context. Apple said it had also established an error 53 outreach program and offered replacements or repairs for many of the phones referred to in the ACCC?s case. It also released an update in February last year to resolve the problem and restore the functionality of affected devices. Apple has previously faced court action in the United States relating to error 53, but the case was thrown out last year. "

Tarun Khanna,03-2017,Data against corrupt people on CVC's portal deleted: Report,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cvc-portal-crashes-narendra-modi-fight-against-corruption/1/905497.html ,"As per an India Today report, the hard disk of Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) portal crashed on November 28 and the data stored online until that date has been lost as it was not backed up. One of those cases which got deleted pertains to alleged corruption in National Textile Corporation under the Textiles Ministry, now headed by Smriti Irani.","In a severe setback to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fight against corruption in public places and his mission to promote Digital India, the portal of the country's anti-graft watchdog Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has not been functioning for about four months now.Sources told India Today that the hard disk of CVC's portal crashed on November 28 and all data stored online till that data has been lost. The problem has been compounded as the data was not backed up.The portal was maintained by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). To make matters worse, CVC's contract with TCS expired in December. There is no annual maintenance contract either between CVC and TCS.The sources said after the grave tragedy, the Centre's web services organisation, National Informatics Centre (NIC), took over the maintenance of the CVC's portal this year. NIC has also been trying to retrieve the old data but without much success.All efforts to talk to senior officials of CVC such as vigilance commissioners Rajiv and TM Bhasin, secretary Nilam Sawhney, additional secretary Salim Haque and director Jyoti Trivedi were in vain.Though new complaints can now be made with CVC and their details would be available, the particulars of almost all the previous cases have been permanently erased.ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN NTCOne of those cases pertain to alleged massive corruption in National Textile Corporation (NTC) under the Union Ministry of Textiles, now headed by Smriti Irani.Mumbai-based whistleblower HR Kosia had filed an RTI application with CVC in 2013 demanding action taken report in an alleged corruption case. He had accused NTC chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) PC Vaish of selling a godown for a song to a private party in 2013.According to Kosia's complaint, Vaish, then NTC's director, finance, had sold off Mumbai-based Poddar Process Malharvadi Kalbadevi worth crores to private builders Om Vastu Shanti for mere Rs 75 lakh. The transaction was allegedly done without due tendering process or without approval from Textiles Ministry and NTC's Board of Directors.The deal was done despite the fact that NTC had won a case against lease holder (Poddar Process) in 2013 when Vaish was finance director.Kosia, who was deputy manager (security and vigilance) with NTC, had to pay a heavy price for bringing to light this corruption and several other cases of irregularities in the Corporation. He was dismissed from service in July, 2016.Kosia's grievance is that the Textiles Ministry neither filed any chargesheet against him nor lodged an FIR nor had a 'panchnama' done.SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS IN CVCFinally, Kosia filed an RTI in the Commission. After several communications, CVC director and Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Jyoti Trivedi replied on December 22, 2016, saying that ""due to technical problem in the working of complaint portal of the Commission, it is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaint at this stage"".She added that the appellate authority in the matter was CVC additional secretary Praveen Sinha.Kosia petitioned Sinha, saying that the CPIO's response was not legally valid as per RTI Act 2005. Sinha replied to Kosia on January 24, and admitted that the ""corruption case lodged with CVC required action taken reports copy"".In his decision, Sinha said, ""I have gone through the relevant records and find that at the time of giving a reply to the appellant (Kosia), the complaint portal was not functioning and this position was intimated to the appellant by the CPIO.""I direct the CPIO concerned (Jyoti Trivedi) to confirm the position regarding complaints mentioned by the appellant in his RTI application and provide an appropriate reply to him within 15 days of the receipt of these orders,"" he said.Sinha further said, ""The issues raised by the appellant have thus been addressed appropriately. However, if the appellant is not satisfied with the above decision, he can make an appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC). The appeal is accordingly disposed (of).""Following the appellate authority's decision, Jyoti Trivedi sent a second reply to Kosia. In her letter dated February 9, she said, ""TCS system of the Commission is still not working. It is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaints at this stage.""Kosia has now made a second appeal to CIC. He also apprehends some major conspiracy behind the whole episode. ""The portal crashing on November 28, CVC's contract with TCS ending just next month, no AMC either between the two and there is no back up of data - all these cannot be coincidences. There is more to it than meets the eye. The PM should have an inquiry ordered into it,"" he said. The fate of Kosia's application is uncertain and so does that of thousands of such cases. While the whistleblowers struggle, action against several alleged corrupt government officials may not be taken ever, dealing a severe blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's crusade against corruption.WATCH: Modi government has zero tolerance on corruption, says his ministerALSO READ: PM Modi thanks diaspora for supporting war against black money, corruptionNo report of RTI activist murder during last 3 years with CVC"

Others registered their opposition to the verdict and sentencing by tweeting under the hashtag #RIPHukumIndonesia, which means ""rest in peace Indonesian law"".","The jailing of Jakarta?s Christian governor on blasphemy charges has sparked outrage from his supporters in Indonesia, rights organisations and the EU.On Tuesday, a court in the capital of the world?s largest Muslim-majority country found Basuki Tjahaja Purnama ? better known by his nickname Ahok ? guilty of blasphemy, sentencing him to two years in prison.?The EU has consistently stated that laws that criminalise blasphemy when applied in a discriminatory manner can have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief,? the EU delegation to Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam said in a statement posted on its website. The Jakarta-based rights group the Setara Institute described the verdict as a ?trial by mob?, while the British ambassador to Indonesia, Moazzam Malik, who is Muslim, tweeted a message of support.I know Ahok. Admire his wk for Jkt. Believe he isn't antiMuslim. Praying for BuVero&kids. Leaders must step up to protect tolerance&harmony. https://t.co/JcxsteEfB4At City Hall on Wednesday morning, an estimated 1,000 people wearing red and white, Indonesia?s national colours, gathered for a spontaneous choir performance in support of Ahok. Conducted by the musician Addie MS, the crowd sang the national anthem, Indonesia Raya, and Pancasila Garuda, a song about Indonesia?s founding principles of unity and diversity.When words fail, music speaks #paduansuarabalaikota #ahok #saveahok #peace #nkrihargamati #garudapancasila pic.twitter.com/CdY64EGiDNOthers registered their opposition to the verdict and sentencing by tweeting under the hashtag #RIPHukumIndonesia, which means ?rest in peace Indonesian law?.The Ahok case has been watched closely as a marker of the commitment to religious tolerance and pluralism in Indonesia, where religious hardliners have been playing an increasingly prominent role in politics.In an unusual move, the panel of five judges on Tuesday dismissed the prosecutor?s recommendations to drop the initial blasphemy charges due to insufficient evidence. Prosecutors had recommended the governor instead face a sentence of two years? probation, and one year in jail if he reoffended. But the judges ? citing among others the ?expert? opinion of an Islamic vigilante group leader ? said they found the minority governor convincingly guilty of blasphemy, incarcerating him for two years. Ahok for months faced the wrath of hardline Islamists after he cited a Qur?anic verse on the campaign trail last September. The verse, he said, had been manipulated by some religious leaders to justify the claim the Muslims should not vote for non-Muslim leaders.Uproar over an edited version of the speech that went viral spilled into a series of angry mass rallies spearheaded by Islamists since late last year, and has catalysed the deepening of religious and ethnic divides in the capital.Some observers argue that religious hardliners may have swayed the Indonesian judiciary.International human rights organisations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the verdict would tarnish Indonesia?s reputation for religious tolerance and pluralism, and urged the country to repeal its ?unjust? blasphemy law. Ahok has indicated he will appeal against the ruling."

Majority of the drivers are not in favour of any strike but some external anti-social elements are illegally preventing the app-based drivers from plying their vehicles?.Transport minister Satyendra Jain also directed his department to inform Delhi Police about locations where groups leading the protest are attacking drivers and ensure criminal complaints are lodged.Travel woesOn Wednesday morning, very few cabs were available to commuters. The waiting time for each being more than 15 minutes and high surge rates being applied.Commuters said that the auto drivers also took advantage of the situation and charged enormous amounts for rides. ?To get to CGO complex from my house in CR park, I had to pay the auto Rs 300 as I had no other option. Instead of cooperating, the auto drivers are having a gala time. People will have to pay when they have no option,? Nikhil Singh, a commuter, said.?One auto driver also told me that it is payback time as these cab aggregators had taken away their business from them. He said that all their customers had shifted to Ola and Uber and they had incurred losses. So, now they have a chance to recover the loss. Amidst all this, it is the commuters who suffer. How do we get to work? These cabs made commuting so convenient that we have now grown used to them and depend on them,? Shelly Malhotra, another commuter said. Strike turns violent Meanwhile, Rahul Kumar, whose cab was burnt on Tuesday night said that he tried to plead with the protesters that its was his brother?s car. ?My car got stolen last year and I had roped in my brother?s car. They did not heed to my request and set the car afire by pouring kerosene,? Kumar said. The police said that they are trying to trace the culprits involved in the incident. ?We have registered an FIR against the culprits who set the cab afire. Investigation is on and police deployed to check activities of protesters,? said Anil Kumar Yadav, circle officer (Indirapuram).Rahul had dropped a passenger at Vaishali Sector-5 and was returning home when his car was stopped by several bike borne men near Green Valley Road in Indirapuram. ?We got a call from the control room about the incident. By the time we reached the spot, the cab was already in flames. The driver had de-boarded and did not sustain any injuries. He told us that the car was set afire by protesters,? said Ajay Sharma, fire safety officer, Vaishali.During past several days, there have been small protests by the agitated cab drivers near Vaishali, Kaushambi Metro stations in Ghaziabad and also close to Delhi-border areas. Two days back, they also stopped the operating cabs and broke windscreens, punctured car tyres near Vaishali metro station. Tuesday, more than a dozen drivers also staged a sit in outside Vaishali metro station and fled the spot after police was informed.Around 1.5 lakh such cabs ply in Delhi-NCR on a daily basis. The strike situation could have been worse but, the kaali-peeli taxi and a section of auto-rickshaw unions pulled out of the strike on Sunday after a meeting with transport minister Satyendra Jain.On Tuesday, the Delhi government also convened a meeting between representatives of Rajdhani Tourist Driver Union and managements of Ola and Uber. The meeting, however, did not include anybody from the union."

Trump earlier proposed attaching solar panels, saying the panels would provide cheap energy to pay for the wall.","Donald Trump doesn?t see the need for a proposed border wall to stretch the length of the roughly 2,000-mile (3,218 km) frontier with Mexico.Instead, he envisions ?anywhere from 700 (1,126 km) to 900 miles (1,448 km) of see-through wall?.Trump?s comments on the wall are the most definitive description he has given on what became a primary campaign promise. During the campaign he vowed to oversee construction of a ?big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door? to let approved immigrants come into the United States.But on his way to Paris, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One: ?It?s a 2,000-mile border, but you don?t need 2,000 miles of wall because you have a lot of natural barriers. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don?t really have people crossing.?There are already about 650 miles (1,046 km) of fencing along the border, all of which is see-through.Trump?s remarks were informal and initially not allowed to be reported. The White House later provided a partial transcript of them.The Mexican border in much of Texas is defined by the Rio Grande, though parts of that river are little more than a trickle of water. About 24 miles (38 km) of the border in Arizona is marked by the Colorado river.Trump also said the wall ?needs transparency?.?You have to be able to see through it,? Trump said, adding that border agents need to know what or who is on the other side of the fence to avoid being hit by sacks of drugs and other contraband.?As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don?t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds (27 kg) of stuff? It?s over,? Trump said.Drug smugglers have tried to fling bundles of drugs over parts of the roughly 650 miles of border that already has fencing or other barriers, using tactics including sling shots and catapults. But it?s unclear if anyone has ever been injured by the flying contraband.This year the government issued two notices for border wall proposals. The first called for a solid structure up to 30 ft (9.14 meters) high that couldn?t be easily breached. The second bid notice called for other types of walls, including something that could be seen through.Homeland security secretary John Kelly has said that border agents need to be able to see what is on the other side of a barrier for security and safety reasons. He has repeatedly said that Trump?s proposed wall would not be ?sea to shining sea?, from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east."

The LPGA said the new code was in place so that ""players present themselves in a professional manner to reflect a positive image for the game.""","The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) has come in for stiff criticism after it introduced a new dress code that forbids female golfers from sporting plunging necklines, leggings or revealing skirts on the course.Initial reactions were overwhelmingly negative, with Teen Vogue accusing the governing body?s policy of ?slut-shaming? female players. The progressive and influential youth magazine also said the code sets players and women in general ?way back?. As of 17 July, the LPGA will crack down on athletic wear following a 2 July email to all players from LPGA player president Vicki Goetze-Ackerman, which detailed an extensive list of clothing that will no longer be allowed on course and at pro-am parties on the tour.Any transgression of the new code, as revealed in a report by Golf Digest, will result in a $1,000 fine for the first offence, with fines doubling for each subsequent breach. Items in the new code were expressed in the following dot points in Goetze-Ackerman?s email:Explaining the new code, Heather Daly-Donofrio, the LPGA tour?s communications and tour operations officer, told Golf Digest: ?The dress code requires players to present themselves in a professional manner to reflect a positive image for the game.? ""Skirt, skort & shorts MUST be long enough to not see your bottom area"" My Sunday school teacher, Sister Margaret, writing #LPGA dress code??While we typically evaluate our policies at the end of the year, based on input from our players, we recently made some minor adjustments to the policy to address some changing fashion trends.

What are we supposed to do now?? a district magistrate from eastern UP asked when told about the orders from the chief minister?s office. On Saturday, controversy erupted after a mud road leading to the house of a slain CRPF sub-inspector in Hamirpur district?s Majhgawa village was covered up by carpets during the CM?s visit. Sources claimed that CM Yogi Adityanath expressed his displeasure over the administration?s failure to ensure proper roads. Officials said the carpet was laid to provide easy access to the house as rain rendered the road slippery.In addition, a luxurious sofa and a cooler were placed and a red carpet laid inside the room where Adityanath spent about 10 minutes. ?I don?t know much but sofa and carpet were set up for the CM,? Saurabh, the son of the martyr, said.Last month, a storm of criticism was unleashed after the administration made similar arrangements for another visit in Deoria but took back the air conditioner and sofa from the family of another slain soldier after Adityanath left the premises.

An official added, ""his behaviour of not daring to smoke conforms with extreme religious thought... As a party chief, he should lead the fight against extreme religious thought.""","leaders From K J M Varma Beijing, Apr 11 (PTI) In an unusual move, China has demoted a ruling Communist party official in the volatile Uygur Muslim majority Xinjiang province for not ""daring"" to smoke in front of local religious leaders, regarding it as a sign of timidity in fighting against extremism. Jelil Matniyaz, the party chief of a village in Hotan, Xinjiang was demoted from ""senior staff member"" to ""staff member"" on March 25 for his ""infirm political stands...and for being afraid to smoke in front of religious figures,"" a notice posted on the Hotan Dailys social media WeChat account said. ""Smoking is a personal choice, and religious and ordinary people should respect each other, but his behaviour of not daring to smoke conforms with extreme religious thought in Xinjiang,"" the Global Times quoted a Hotan official as saying. ""As a party chief, he should lead the fight against extreme religious thought, otherwise, he would fail to confront the threat of extreme regional forces,"" the official said. ""According to local religion customs, smoking is not allowed in front of older or religious people,"" Turgunjun Tursun, a professor with the Zhejiang Normal University, said. However, some religious people force ordinary citizens also to comply with the requirements, a senior official who had been working in Xinjiang for years, told the paper. The officials demotion is an isolated case, Tursun said, adding that the local government should balance de-extremist behaviour and local customs in the crackdown on extremism. The move to demote the official comes as authorities intensified their efforts to curb religious extremism. Early this month, the province where the Chinese security forces are battling recurring attacks by Uygur militants enacted a new law banning a wide range of acts, including wearing veils or growing ""abnormal""Â beards. In Xinjiang, the Turkic speaking Uygurs are restive for several years over increasing settlements of Han population from other provinces. China blames separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Al-Qaeda affiliated group for the spate of violent attacks in the province. A number of its members reported to have joined the Islamic State militant group to fight in Syria. China believes that they would return to carry out attacks in the country. "

The NTCA has stated that all tiger deaths will be treated as poaching unless proven otherwise, making it 65% of the total deaths this year.","The euphoria over rise in world tiger population early this year may have been misplaced for India as the official data placed before Parliament shows that 98 tigers died in the country till November 16, 2016, a steep 25 per cent rise over last year when 78 deaths were reported.The figures collected by National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) also take the wind out of government efforts to encourage tiger foundations for sensitising the public and fighting poachers to save the big cats. The environment and forest ministry released Rs1.82-crore grant in 2016 for tiger conservation against Rs30 lakh the previous year.Also Read: Tiger population is rising, but will it get doubled by 2022?""Poaching and poisoning continue to be tigers' worst enemies in the wild,"" environment minister Anil Madhav Dave told Mail Today, explaining the challenges before the government.

The state reported four tiger deaths within a fortnight in November, with one death due to overdose of tranquiliser.POLITICAL NEXUSThe central Indian state, whose tourism arrivals is soaring every year banks heavily on tiger population in its three famous reserves. However, tiger population in Madhya Pradesh has come down from 700 in 2000 to less than half, at 301 in 2016. The state now trails behind Karnataka and Uttarakhand in tiger population.There are many anti-poaching measures initiated by NTCA which coordinate with state forest departments, but to little avail. In fact, poaching cases increased by more than 100 per cent this year. The figures attribute nearly 30 tiger deaths to poaching this year, which is more than double of last year's figure of 14. Top forest officials that Mail Today spoke with expressed helplessness in their fight against poachers and at times cited ""political pressures'' leading to more frequent man-tiger conflict.Some point fingers at archaic resources at hand, immobility against hi-tech and heavilyarmed poachers around Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Some poachers belong to criminal social groups like Pardis, Bahelias, Bawarias and Bongias and are very strongly networked in Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.RED CORRIDORS"

Ramesh Mane was out on a trip with his friends, who while coming back realised Mane was missing. His friends said they were surprised on finding that Mane did not have major injuries.","A 40-year-old person from the city was rescued a day after he fell into a 150-feet gorge at Madhe ghat in Velha taluka. He was on a trip with his friends on Sunday.Ramesh Mane, an employee of Thermax India Ltd, had gone with his group of 8-10 friends to Madhe Ghat, famous for scenic waterfall, in Velha taluka. While coming back, his friends realised that Mane was not with them, prompting a search for him. The search operation however had to be stalled due to heavy rainfall and thick fog.Â After realising that Mane had gone missing, his friends informed others including Thermax workers union president who in turn asked his friend Sachin Gaikwad  for help. According to his friends, Mane had to spend the entire night in the deep gorge while clinging on to a tree branch. Â ?They were shocked, frightened and were totally clueless. I told them to contact Velha police station and register a complaint and meanwhile, I called my friend Sachin Gaikwad who is known for rescue missions. He immediately responded and reached Velha in the middle of the night,? said Dinesh Dakhave, Thermax workers union president.Â Gaikwad and his team reached Velha early Monday morning. ?We made two teams and started search operation in every direction of the plateau. As we climbed down the ghat, we spotted Mane in a deep gorge. He was clinging to a nearby branch and was moving abruptly. There was no way to find out whether he was dead or alive. We shouted and whistled to which he responded after several minutes,? said Gaikwad, who works for Dadoji Kondev Bouldering Gym in Kondhwa.Â The rescue team realised that they were short in man power, as Mane was stuck in an inaccessible spot and it was not easy to pull him out to safe area. So, Gaikwad walked back to the village and contacted Shivdurg Mitra Pratishan of Lonavala and asked for technical help.Â Meanwhile, one of the rescuers managed to reach Mane, so the team acted swiftly and rather than waiting for the technical team, they brought Mane out with help from local villagers.Â ?We were surprised when we found out Mane was not majorly injured. However, he wasn?t able to walk properly as he had fallen down almost 150-feet. So we carried him to the village where their team was ready with the vehicle. He was admitted to a local hospital in Velha. I fear he had some internal bleeding, but was alive, that?s the main thing,? added Gaikwad."

Jain said in a statement.But if the allegations are substantiated, it will be a major setback to AAP and the government headed by Arvind Kejriwal. The central claim, which powered the party so dramatically to power in Delhi two years ago, was built on anti-corruption. Coming just ahead of the municipal elections in Delhi, the revelations could potentially impact AAP?s prospects in the electoral contest.The AAP also denied all charges.?There has been no order that has been received by Satyendar Jain on this issue. He was an architect by profession before he joined politics. He was a member of the board of the companies but he quit six months before he was given a ticket by the AAP in 2013,? said a senior party leader, who did not wish to be named.The provisional attachment orders, dated February 27, were issued under the Benami Prohibition transactions act 1988 by the initiating officer of the National capital territory of Delhi to Indo Metalimpex Pvt Ltd, Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd, Paryas Infosolutions and Mangalaytan Projects Pvt Ltd under the act.The order said that cash consideration for making illegal entries in Indo Metalimpex Pvt Ltd and Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd was provided by Jain. The money received from the accommodation entries in the form of share capital/premium was used to purchase the properties, the order added. Jain said in his statement that he had not been associated since July 31, 2013 with any of the companies. ?I have earned all my income with my hard work and I have been a tax payer for decades. I am not afraid of any probe about my income details, nor am I scared of any political vendetta, but I reserve the right for appropriate legal action in case my name is unnecessarily dragged into a controversy.?The AAP has, in the past, claimed a witch-hunt by a ?hostile? union government led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), a political rival. Since 2015, more than ten MLAs of the Delhi assembly have been arrested in various cases.This is not the first time Jain has come under the scanner. According to the Press Trust of India, in September, the income tax department issued summons Jain and asked him to appear in connection with a tax evasion probe against certain Kolkata-based firms."

The state will spend around ?36,000 crore to fund the loan waiver which will benefit around 86 lakh farmers. Loan waiver for farmers was one of the biggest poll promises of the Bharatiya Janata Party.","Delivering on the Bharatiya Janata Party's poll promise, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today waived off farmers' loan of upto Rs 1 lakh. The decision taken in the first meeting of Adityanath Cabinet will add a burden of Rs 30,729 crore on the state exchequer and benefit nearly 2.15 crore farmers. Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets (NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off. The BJP, which won a massive majority bagging 312 seats in the 403-seat Uttar Pradesh Assembly, in its Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra (manifesto), had promised to waive the loans of small and marginal farmers.Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had said during campaigning that writing off farm loans would be among the foremost tasks of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.Although there is no Constitutional compulsion of convening the first cabinet meeting within a certain period, traditionally the ruling party has held it within a week or so of forming the government.The Adityanath government was sworn-in on March 19.Government sources said around 2.30 crore farmers in the state suffered losses due to natural calamities in the recent past and were unable to repay loans amounting to about Rs 62,000 crore.They also said that it could be difficult to handle the burden of loan waiver in a single financial year and that was one of the reasons to put the cabinet meeting on hold till a way was found to honour the prime minister's poll promise.With inputs from Balkrishna ALSO READ:Â  Yogi Adityanath's first interview after taking charge of UP, says Ayodhya issue should be resolved through talksYogi Adityanath gives Uttar Pradesh's bureaucracy the jitters"

Radhika Chugh,07-2017,Over ?4 cr allocated to revive Delhi's Walled City Museum ,http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/centre-allocates-rs-4-22-crore-for-revival-of-walled-city-museum-at-lahori-gate/story-sRJr83NcMdClbTtlomVdcI.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"The Culture Ministry has allocated ?4.22 crore for the restoration and revival of Delhi's Walled City Museum. The museum, which was inaugurated in 2004, has been locked for almost a decade due to negligence. The project, initiated by Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel, aims to develop the museum as a ""one-stop destination"" for studying the culture of the Walled City.","The Walled City museum, located in an 88-year-old haveli at Lahori Gate - Khari Baoli Chowk, which had been lying in a neglected state, will now be revived with the union culture ministry agreeing to allocate Rs 4.22 crore for the same. Inaugurated 13 years ago, the facility had fallen prey to negligence of the civic body, thus losing sheen soon after its opening. The two-storeyed haveli has been lying locked for almost a decade. The number of visitors dwindled over the years and encroachers returned to the site. In want of adequate maintenance, the about 1,000-yard structure has turned into a dump. Union youth affairs and sport minister Vijay Goel, who initiated the project during his second term as a Member of Parliament from Chandni Chowk around 2004, had sent a proposal to the culture ministry seeking funds for the restoration of the facility as ?a heritage museum and interpretation of Shahjahanabad?. The proposal was prepared by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). After examining the scheme, the ministry gave its approval in March, but the work could not be initiated as the fund was not transferred. ?The first instalment, a grant of Rs 1.69 crore, has just been released to the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the nodal agency for executing the restoration project. I expect the work to begin soon,? said Goel.However, the minister added that he wanted a non-government agency to take up the project. ?I don?t trust the municipal corporation. I want other agencies like INTACH or similar bodies to be roped in for the purpose. The project is getting delayed because of the corporation?s lackadaisical attitude,? he said. As per the revival plan, artifacts, articles, rare photos and paintings depicting the culture and lifestyle of early residents of Shahjahanabad (during Mughal period) is slated to be exhibited. A library with a space for research scholars is part of the plan. This will be a one-stop destination, where a visitor will be able to study the composite culture of the Walled City under one roof, said Goel.?Articles like utensils, garments and other exhibits such as hookah will be displayed. Literature pertaining to the city and the history of the place since its inception will also be provided, so that people coming to the museum can learn about it. We will also brief tourists about places to see in old Delhi and what to eat where. We basically aim to recreate the scene of yesteryears,? the minister said. Once it is restored, cultural events are also likely to be hosted here. The haveli was constructed in 1929. Until it was turned into a museum, a municipal dispensary was being run in its two of its rooms and the remaining part was abandoned. Goel contributed funds from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development (MPLAD) fund to restore the building as the Walled City museum."

Earlier, over 3,000 doctors in Maharashtra had gone on strike for five days over the increasing incidents of violence against doctors. AIIMS doctors had also worn helmets to work in solidarity with their colleagues.","Rising violence against doctors has prompted nearly 1,500 resident doctors from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to learn taekwondo so that they are able to defend themselves on duty. In March, after three incidents of violence were reported in three days, more than 3,000 resident doctors, working in the emergency, out-patient departments and wards, went on strike for five days in Maharashtra. ?We had supported our counterparts in Mumbai by wearing helmets to work in March. This is because we are genuinely concerned about our safety. Keeping the same in mind, we had requested the AIIMS administration to organise self-defence classes for us. They granted us permission to conduct taekwondo classes in AIIMS gymkhana club,? said Dr Vijay Gurjar, president of the resident doctors? association.The doctors, in batches of 100, will train at the gymkhana club between 7-8 pm every day from May 15. The basic course will be for 6 months and the black belt course for 30 months.According to a report in the Lancet journal, while 75% doctors in tertiary care hospitals face physical or verbal violence at work at least once in lifetime, over 40% of them faced it in 2016.The problem is multifactoral. Overcrowding in public health facilities forcing doctors to spend less time with patients, corruption and over-charging for services (in which the referring doctor gets a cut) leading to the breakdown in the doctor-patient trust are some of the reasons recognised by the study.?Doctors are forced to spend less time listening to the patients or their caregivers. The concept of shared decision making is almost absent. The average conversation between a doctor and a patient might last just a few seconds,? said Dr Vijay Nath Mishra, neurology professor, Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Varanasi. VIOLENCE REGISTRYThe IMA will launch a registry where doctors can report any incidence of violence along with evidence such as videos, photos, CCTV footage, and newspaper clippings. The doctors? body will then conduct an investigation and do a root cause analysis.?This will help us in understanding why violence is happening, predict when the violence might happen and look at measures to prevent such incidences,? said Dr Dr KK Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).WHAT PATIENTS WANT?Confrontations happen because of the anger caused by non-fulfilment of desire. Hence, we need to understand what the patients really want,? said Dr Aggarwal.A survey done by the IMA found that 90% of the patients wanted doctors acknowledge and address them, 92% wanted doctors to listen, 89% wanted the doctors to explain what the illness is and keep them informed throughout. Around 75% of the people also wanted their doctors to review ? ask them if they understood and, if not, help them understand. 40% of the respondents also wanted the doctors to thank them. ?The patients said that they always thank the doctors, but they wanted that the doctor thank them in return as they gave them an opportunity to treat their relative. We called the study ALERT ? Acknowledge, Listen, Explain, Review and Thank,? said Dr Aggarwal."

The court also directed him to pay a compensation of ?10 lakh to the family of the deceased and ?2 lakh for the injured victim.","A Delhi court on Saturday sentenced 30-year-old Utsav Bhasin, to two?years in prison for the 2008 BMW hit-and-run case. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the deceased and Rs 2 lakh for the injured. The victim, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the sentence. Mrigank Shrivastava, who was at the court proceedings said, ?I am very unhappy. Initially, the harsher charges dropped and now two years for killing a person and destroying my life. I have spent around Rs 17 lakh in treatment and I have got just Rs 2 lakh as compensation.? Shrivastav had suffered a leg injury in the accident while his friend Anuj Chauhan had died. Additional Sessions Judge Sanjeev Kumar passed the order around 4.50pm in a packed courtroom. Utsav Bhasin, son of a Haryana-based businessman, was held guilty of rash driving, voluntarily causing hurt on provocation and causing death by negligence. The court had passed the verdict in May this year. Bhasin was, however, acquitted of charges of culpable homicide, in which the maximum punishment is up to 10 years.Read: Five other infamous luxury car mishaps on Delhi roadsOn September 11, 2008, Bhasin, who was driving his BMW car, hit two men ? Anuj Chauhan and Mrigank Shrivastava ? near Moolchand flyover in south Delhi. The two men, who were on a motorcycle, were returning home after watching the movie Rock On. Chauhan died two days after the accident and Shrivastava suffered leg injuries. At that time, Bhasin was 21 years old and was doing BBA at IILM?in Lodhi Colony.   He was, later, arrested from the Interstate Bus Terminus at?Kashmere Gate while attempting to flee to Chandigarh.  He was later released on bail after giving two sureties of Rs 20,000 each. Chauhan?s brother Kahitij Chauhan said that the family will go to High Court and questioned why harsher charges were dropped it should be reinstated demand harsher charges to beIn May, the court had convicted Bhasin under Sections 304A (causing death by rash and negligent act), 279 (driving rashly which could endanger human life) and 338 (causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).He was acquitted of charges under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) citing lack of evidence to prosecute him on harsher terms.The court observed that the witnesses did not support the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.Anuj Chauhan, who suffered injuries on cervical spine and later died, was working as a freelance journalist and pursuing a course in graphic designing and animation at a private institution in south Delhi."
Pragya Swastik,07-2017,Microsoft to shut down MS Paint 32 years after its launch,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/24/microsoft-paint-kill-off-after-32-years-graphics-editing-program?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Microsoft has announced its long-standing basic graphics editing program 'MS Paint' will no longer be available with the next Windows 10 update called the Autumn Creators Update. The program was first released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985. MS Paint's removal is a part of Microsoft's plan to shut programs that are ""not in active development.""","Microsoft?s next Windows 10 update, called the Autumn (or Fall in the US) Creators Update, will bring a variety of new features. But one long-standing stalwart of the Windows experience has been put on the chopping block: Microsoft Paint.First released with the very first version of Windows 1.0 in 1985, Paint in its various guises would be one of the first graphics editors used by many and became a core part of Windows. Starting life as a 1-bit monochrome licensed version of ZSoft?s PC Paintbrush, it wasn?t until Windows 98 that Paint could save in JPEG.With the Windows 10 Creators Update, released in April, Microsoft introduced the new Paint 3D, which is installed alongside traditional Paint and features 3D image making tools as well as some basic 2D image editing. But it is not an update to original Paint and doesn?t behave like it.Now Microsoft has announced that, alongside Outlook Express, Reader app and Reading list, Microsoft Paint has been signalled for death having been added to the ?features that are removed or deprecated in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update? list.Falling under the deprecated column for apps that are ?not in active development and might be removed in future releases?, Microsoft Paint?s ticket has been called and now it?s only a matter of time before it is removed like your favourite piece of old furniture from your childhood home.Paint was never one of the most capable apps, and was limited to the bitmap (BMP) and PCX formats until 1998, but if you wanted to scribble something out using your mouse or make a quick cut and paste job, Paint was always there, even on work computers.The most recent version of Paint for Windows 7 and later was much improved, but still considered feature poor compared to other free alternatives such as the third-party Paint.NET.When Microsoft Paint will officially be removed from Windows has yet to be confirmed, while a precise date for the release of the Windows 10 Autumn Creators Update is equally up in the air. Whether, like Clippy, Windows users will celebrate or decry Paint?s removal, it will be a moment in the history of Windows as one of its longest-standing apps is put out to pasture."
Saloni Tandon,07-2017,Cricketers question ?25 lakh award for select women players,http://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/bcci-officials-fume-as-more-women-cricketers-seek-payments/story-Qpoz99YcHTUezIOJFAwN5J.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Former women cricketers have reportedly written to BCCI, questioning the Committee of Administrators' decision of awarding select ex-players a one-time payment of ?25 lakh. The board has claimed that a few former players have also demanded the amount, but the BCCI is not able to verify their credentials. Three players were awarded ?25 lakh, while three were given ?15 lakh.","The Committee of Administrators? decision to make one-time payments to a few former women cricketers has left the Indian cricket board (BCCI) in a bind as it is now being approached by more players seeking similar benefits.BCCI sources say they have received five-six applications where some women cricketers have questioned the basis for awarding cheques to only a few, claiming they too deserve money.A top board official from South Zone told HT: ?The CoA?s decision to give those one-time cheques has left us in a quandary. There are five-six players already who want similar cheques. The problem is authenticating each and every application that is coming our way. Records of some of the players are not even available and cross-checking for authenticity is very difficult.?READ | Anurag Thakur won?t shy away from ?accepting BCCI?responsibility?In addition to the one-time cheques, handed over at the IPL opening ceremony in April, the Supreme Court-appointed CoA had also pushed for a monthly pension of Rs 15000 for former women cricketers who have played between one and four Tests.Although there were reports that BCCI had approved that in a June meeting, sources say the issue is still in limbo as it is yet to be approved by the treasurer. Those who have played 10 or more Tests are expected to get Rs 22,500 per month.The official said the decision on pension is likely to make matters worse.The board officials are peeved because all these ex-cricketers played under the aegis of Women?s Cricket Association of India, which ran the game until BCCI took over. The BCCI officials says they don?t even have the records of the applicants to authenticate their claims.Row over paymentsThe CoA, which has former India women?s team skipper, Diana Edulji, as a member, had asked BCCI to give one-time payments to six women players. Deepa Kulkarni, Sangita Dabir and Arundhati Ghosh got Rs 25 lakh each while Behroze Edulji, who is Diana?s sister, Sunita Singh and Vrinda Bhagat were given Rs 15 lakh each.These amounts were approved after much drama as it was considered a policy decision that could only be taken by the BCCI general body and not CoA. However, the BCCI eventually relented.READ |?Accolades pour in for India for entering ICC?Women?s World?Cup semis?The same thing is happening with the pension also as it is a policy decision and needs to be taken at general body level,? the official said.Sunita Singh had played two Tests and 18 ODIs while Vrinda Bhagat played two Tests and 11 ODIs. Behroze had played just one Test.?The feeling in the Board circles is that the CoA didn?t take into account the gravity of the issue.?"

Prashanti Moktan,04-2017,"Suhana, Aryan aren't joining films as actors right now: SRK",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/shah-rukh-khan-interview-suhana-abram-aryan-autobiography/1/926968.html ,"Actor Shah Rukh Khan has said that currently his children Suhana and Aryan are not thinking of joining films as actors. Talking about Suhana, SRK said, ""I think she's a great actor. She really likes it. If the passion is retained in the next two-three years, come and act."" He also joked that his youngest son AbRam is already acting.","Shah Rukh Khan, as we all know, is a fantastic speaker and an erudite writer. So it would not be hard to believe that the actor has been working on an autobiography for quite some time. In an exclusive interview with India Today's Koel Purie, Shah Rukh Khan spoke about his still-in-progress book, dreams, acting and his children, AbRam, Suhana and Aryan.When asked why his book, which SRK once called '20 Years of a Decade' is still not out in stores yet, Shah Rukh said, ""I am still writing it. I have more memories than most of the people so it's taking a longer time.""On keeping your dreams alive in the midst of outstanding success, SRK said, ""I think even with success, the only way to keep your dream alive is to find pleasure in small things, the littlest of things. If you look after the big things, you are only managing success.""An example of finding pleasure in small things, according to Shah Rukh Khan was when the actor made a house out of Lego with his son AbRam.On the topic of his daughter Suhana joining Bollywood as an actor, Shah Rukh said, ""You need to be minimal qualification of a graduate before you even think of coming and learning any way. Go out, do some theatre, finish your schooling, finish your college, then study for a couple of years about acting. (sic)""""If she gets into the field that I already am in, somewhere, even without wanting, even though I would like to avoid it, the life lessons will permeate on to her through me. And I've already done it. Why would you want to learn from something that has been seen, I've been there, done that; find something new, go beyond. I'm not saying go beyond me and learn and come back and all only, I don't think she needs this kind of a shadow over her. So go out. (sic)"" Shah Rukh added.""When you go to a school, when you go to a college; failure, and passing, bad treatment, good treatment, happy days, bad days, sad days that happen in a school and college are, I think, really important life lessons. But bringing them on a set, and saying, 'this is Shah Rukh Khan's daughter', as a matter of fact will give them less life lessons because they will treat her like a star's daughter. That's not cool. I think she should just be treated normally in school, college, by teachers. I don't want her to go out there and prove her worth as a great actor to someone. I think she's a great actor. She really likes it. If the passion is retained in the next two/three years, come and act. But at this point, no, none of them are thinking of coming and joining films as actors. AbRam is already acting,"" Shah Rukh Khan continued."

We are among the 15 other selected states. A special theme song on education and how it carves a good citizen out of a human being is also being prepared.

There will also be a replica of a model school,? Mishra added.The government presented four themes to the Centre. These included the work done in the health and education sectors, the communal and cultural diversity of Delhi and a mix of all key projects across sectors."

Along with high-speed trains connecting the airport to Gurugram, Panipat, Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Alwar, it will also have a metro station, and a railway station. Sarai Kale Khan already has an Interstate Bus Terminus which will be redeveloped under the plan.","Three high-speed trains connecting the airport to Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Panipat and Alwar; a metro station connecting the entire Delhi; a railway station and an interstate bus terminus ? Sarai Kale Khan is going to be the biggest transport hub of Delhi. The Delhi government has planned an Rs 550 crore makeover plan for the existing bus terminal with interchange facility for every mode of transport. Facilitated with lifts, escalators, walkalators, foot overbridges and underpasses, all modes of transport will come under one roof. Currently, interstate buses and trains bound for Mumbai side operates from Sarai Kale Khan, which is next to the Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station. The metro station will be on line 7 of Delhi Metro connecting Mukundpur (Majlis Park) to Shiv Vihar.?We are going to develop it as a major transport hub. This will be a one stop destination for the need of travellers within Delhi and outside Delhi too. A plan has been prepared, where commercial spaces like malls and food courts will be developed and all modes of transport will be interlinked,? said a transport department official.Delhi government?s transport department has prepared the plan, but the public works department might execute the project. A discussion on this is currently on and the project will be completed in two years.?Currently, there is haphazard movement of traffic. We want the UP-bound buses to start from here and the footfall will increase first after the operation of Delhi Metro in 2018 and then the operation of Delhi-Meerut high-speed rail corridor in 2023. We are developing it in a way so that it can handle over 10 lakh passengers every day,? the official added.The underground metro station at Sarai Kale Khan will be operational by next year and will connect the commuters with almost every part of the capital.?Interchange is our focus and future projects are kept in a mind while developing the area.

The sealed packet discovered by security personnel during a check contained some powder weighing about 50 grams and has been handed over to the city police for further examination.","Security agencies have found a packet of suspicious powder inside the Uttar Pradesh assembly two days after discovering plastic explosives inside the premises, an incident that sent shockwaves through the political establishment. Sources said, on Friday evening, security personnel found a sealed packet containing some powder weighing about 50 grams during a check. This came after 150 grams of the high-potential explosive Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) powder was found near the seat of the leader of opposition on July 12.The sealed packet was handed over to the city police for further examination. The state Anti Terror Squad (ATS) and Inspector General of Police (IGP) Aseem Arun confirmed the recovery and added that primary inquiry suggested the packet contained magnesium sulphate and would be sent for the forensic examination. He said the magnesium sulphate is used as drying agent for packing material. Arun said pan masala and other eatables packets are usually thrown inside the premises and that anti-mine, anti-sabotage and bomb disposal squads were sanitising every corner of the Vidhan Bhawan premises. On July 12, the recovery of PETN powder weighing around 150 grams below the chair?s cushion in the arena where legislators sit during the assembly session triggered panic. Sleuths initially believed the PETN was simple powder and sent it for forensic examination at State Forensic Science Laboratory in Mahanagar, Lucknow. The alert was sounded after the forensic experts confirmed it as high-potential explosive on Friday. A PETN sample however is also been sent to explosive unit of Agra forensic science laboratory for check its purity level. An FIR against unidentified persons was also lodged with Hazratganj police station on Friday after the recovery of explosive powder.The PETN recovery has prompted chief minister Yogi Adityanath to tighten security and call for a National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe.Police think the explosives were transported into UP from Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh or some other state where it is often used for mining. They are also questioning a Muslim youth from Deoria who threatened to blow up the assembly on Independence Day."
Ayushi Ahluwalia,07-2017,Shiv Sena leader arrested over Mumbai building collapse ,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-building-collapse-death-toll-rises-to-12-shiv-sena-leader-booked/story-2L99IrPruSebtbScnvDdfN.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shitap was booked for culpable homicide over the collapse of a four-storey building in which 12 people were killed in Mumbai's Ghatkopar on Tuesday. Shitap, who owned the building's ground floor, reportedly carried out illegal renovations that weakened the building. Interestingly, the building wasn't on the Mumbai civic body's list of 791 unsafe buildings this year.","A dozen people, including two infants, were killed when a 35-year-old four-storey building collapsed on Tuesday in the Ghatkopar suburb of Mumbai, a tragedy that repeats almost every monsoon in India?s space-starved financial capital.The Siddhi Sai building at Damodar Park near Shreyas cinema in western Ghatkopar came apart and trapped more than 20 people around 10.45am. Many of them are still under the rubble.Among the dead were four old people, three-month-old Renuka Thak and Krishu Dongre, who was one-and-a-half years old.The ground floor housed a nursing home, which was vacant, while the rest of the building was occupied by three or four families on each floor. Lalit Thak, who lost daughter Renuka, had shifted to the building from nearby slums three months ago.Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shitap, who owns the ground floor and allegedly made structural changes that weakened the building, was charged with culpable homicide and detained by police.Mumbai mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar denied Shitap was from his party and said: ?Appropriate action must be taken against the culprit, whoever he is.?Residents said pillars and beams were damaged when the ground floor was renovated and that caused the building to collapse. Civic officials, however, refused to assign a reason and said the cause will be known after investigation.Binita Ramchandani, a resident whose mother was injured, blamed the Shiv Sena leader for the tragedy.?Despite residents objecting his altering the building?s pillars, he went ahead because of his political clout. He was trying to convert it into a guesthouse,? she alleged.Pravin Chheda, a Congress leader, said Shitap must compensate the people.Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta ordered a probe while police are investigating if negligence is involved in the disaster.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, there were 15 flats, three each on every floor, of which nine were vacant.The fire brigade pressed 90 personnel, 14 engines, two rescue vans and nine ambulances in its rescue efforts. About 300 rescuers, including National Disaster Response Force members, were working late into the night, looking for signs of life and bodies trapped in the rubble.Sanjay Pawar, from the nearby slums, said he dashed for the site after hearing a crashing sound that he initially thought came from a falling tree. Samriddhi Mayekar, another slum-dweller who worked at the building, saw the structure shake vigorously before it came crashing down.Building collapses are common in Mumbai, especially during the monsoon that runs from late June to September.The civic authorities conduct pre-rain checks and declare buildings unsafe when they find one. The Ghatkopar apartment did not feature among the dangerous buildings on the BMC?s list of 791 structures identified unsafe this year.But Mumbai is susceptible with millions forced to live in cramped, ramshackle properties because of rising real estate prices and a lack of housing for the poor.The city has been hit by several deadly building collapses in recent years, often caused by shoddy construction, poor quality materials or ageing buildings.In 2013, 145 people were killed in three separate building collapses around Mumbai, the highest in recent years.A dilapidated building left 12 people dead when it collapsed near the city in August 2015. Nine people died the same month when another old three-storey building collapsed in monsoon rain in the Mumbai suburb of Thakurli.In a separate incident on Tuesday, a building partially collapsed in Kolkata after days of rain. Several people were trapped in the rubble, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.With agency inputs"

China claims it enjoys exclusive control over a massive portion of the energy-rich South China Sea while the US considers it international waters.","Boris Johnson has committed the UK?s two brand new aircraft carriers to freedom of navigation exercises in the fiercely contested waters of the South China Sea.In a pointed declaration aimed squarely at China, whose island-building and militarisation in the sea has unnerved western powers, the British foreign secretary said that when the ships came into service they would be sent to the Asia-Pacific region as one of their first assignments.?One of the first things we will do with the two new colossal aircraft carriers that we have just built is send them on a freedom of navigation operation to this area,? Johnson said in Sydney on Thursday, ?to vindicate our belief in the rules-based international system and in the freedom of navigation through those waterways which are absolutely vital for world trade.?He later reiterated the point in a speech ? only to confuse listeners by adding in a Q&A: ?We haven?t yet quite decided to do that ? but they are coming.?The South China Sea is one of the busiest commercial sea routes in the world, carrying $5tn worth of trade a year. China claims it enjoys exclusive control over a massive portion of the sea ? within the so-called nine-dash line ? based on ancient rights marked in 600-year-old mariners? books.In dispute with four neighbouring countries, China has claimed sovereignty over islands in international waters in the sea, and built up sandbars and atolls into usable land. Several key islands have been populated and militarised with airfields, weapons systems and ports.Last year the permanent court of arbitration in The Hague ruled there was no legal basis for China?s historic claim, a decision China has furiously rejected.Sending Britain?s newest and most expensive ships to the region to carry out manoeuvres similar to those conducted by the US navy could be seen by Beijing as provocative.At 280 metres and 65,000 tonnes, the UK?s newest aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is the largest ship ever built for the Royal Navy. It is undergoing its maiden sea trials off the coast of Scotland and is expected to be accepted by the navy towards the end of the year.The second ship in the class, HMS Prince of Wales, is being fitted out in the Rosyth dock and will be officially named in September.Speaking in Sydney after discussions with his Australian counterpart, Julie Bishop, Johnson said the UK and Australia had reaffirmed ?our shared dedication to the rules-based international system that has been the guarantor of stability and, of course, also of prosperity for the last 70 years.?He added: ?In a volatile and unpredictable world it is more important than ever to nurture the friendships that we know best and that matter to us the most and with people we trust the most.?Bishop said the ministers had discussed the South China Sea as one of the pressing ?challenges? of the Asia-Pacific region. ?We had a long discussion about the Pacific and the opportunities for deeper British engagement in our part of the world ? we also see the United Kingdom as being a natural partner with us in the development and security of the Pacific,? she said.In a speech in Sydney later in front of hundreds of politicians and businesspeople, Johnson reiterated the pledge to send the carriers.?If you look at those vessels ? you will see that they are not only longer than the entire Palace of Westminster but, I think you will agree, they are more persuasive than most of the arguments deployed in the House of Commons,? he said.?And we pledge to do this [send the carriers] not because we have enemies in the region ? but because we believe in upholding the rule of law.?However, within minutes of the speech he appeared to sow some confusion over his promise.

Australia will sign a free trade agreement first with Europe, then with the UK.Johnson said he expected, in negotiating a UK-Australia free trade deal, significant pressure to agree to a relaxing of visa conditions for Australians travelling to and working in the UK.?I certainly support an open and generous regime in favour of our Australian friends being able to come, and our European friends, why not?

Chhavi Tyagi,06-2017,Cows sold online after ban on sale of cattle for slaughter,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cow-slaughter-beef-ban-gau-rakshak-olx-cattle-sold-online/1/967924.html ,"Days after the Centre banned the sale of cattle for slaughter in the animal markets across the country, cows are being sold online on e-marketplaces such as OLX. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows anymore. Anyone can come and beat us,"" said a cattle owner adding that he was open to a distress sale for 50% less than the market price.","Hamstrung by the government's restrictions on sale of cattle, farmers and livestock traders have found greener pastures in digital India. So, a swift search on online marketplaces such as OLX shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.The environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. The rule came as part of a tough new law against animal cruelty, but critics say they are aimed at placating hardline Hindu supporters of the Narendra Modi government. The Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday suspended the order for four weeks.Ravi Sharma from Uttar Pradesh's holy city Varanasi, which Prime Minister Modi represents in Parliament, seemed a little wary when spoken to about his online post selling a desi brown cow for Rs 75,000. He first wanted to know what this correspondent intended to do with it and what community she belonged to, categorically stating that he has no interest in selling to a certain minority group.Not far away from Varanasi, in Ghazipur, Bheem Singh is keen to get rid of three cows at the earliest. So much so that he is open to a distress sale for as much as 50 per cent less than the market price for cows. ""It's too dangerous keeping cows any more. Anyone can come and beat us,"" he said while pushing this correspondent to close the deal over the phone.The past two years have seen a rise in vigilante attacks on Muslims and lower caste Hindus involved in the cattle trade, leading to several deaths. A group of alleged ""cow protectors"" thrashed two meat traders on the suspicion that they were carrying beef on May 26. Police in Rajasthan's Bhilwara arrested five people, including an alleged member of the RSS - the BJP's ideological mentor - who torched a truck last week that they thought was carrying cows for slaughter.Several state governments have appealed to the PM to repeal the order, which they say was issued without consultations with them. Some have decided to drag the Centre to court. Environment minister Harsh Vardhan had said that cattle bought and sold directly from farms would not be affected by the government's order. ""The aim of the rules is only to regulate the animal market and sale of cattle in them and ensure (the) welfare of cattle"" in the markets,"" he had said. But many commentators see the move as a blow to beef and leather exports that will leave hundreds of thousands jobless and deprive millions of Christians, Muslims and poor Hindus of a cheap source of protein.It's not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. They have been available occasionally under the pets section. But there has been a sudden surge since the BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh in March with priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath taking the chief minister's post, and the rise of the gau rakshaks, or cow vigilantes."

The former world number one posted a picture of herself in a swimsuit, showing her baby bump, with the caption '20 weeks' before deleting it within minutes. The 35-year-old has been engaged to Reddit Co-founder Alexis Ohanian.","Serena Williams is pregnant with her first child, her spokesperson has confirmed.The tennis star hinted at the good news when she posted a photo of herself on Snapchat wearing a swimsuit and revealing what appeared to be a large baby bump with the caption ?20 weeks? on Wednesday. The snap was deleted less than a half hour later.However, Williams? team confirmed the implications of the photo later in the day. ?I?m happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this fall,? a spokesperson for Williams told the Guardian by email.The Women?s Tennis Association, which listed Williams as scheduled to enter next month?s Madrid Open as recently as Monday, said they had yet to be contacted by anyone from the American?s team regarding her status.?We have not been informed, nor do we have confirmation,? a tour spokesperson told the Guardian. ?We will let you know once we have further information.?Serena's snap suggests that she won the Australian Open without dropping a set while pregnant. pic.twitter.com/ltPndJRJBqWilliams, 35, announced she was engaged to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in December. The announcement left the sport?s chattering class wondering to what degree she was looking ahead to life after tennis.She answered that speculation with brio at the Australian Open, capturing her 23rd major singles title without dropping a set, to eclipse Steffi Graf?s record for grand slam titles in the Open era and regain the No1 ranking she had ceded in the fall to Germany?s Angelique Kerber.But she has been inactive since her win over elder sister Venus in the final at Melbourne Park. Last month, Williams pulled out of Indian Wells and Miami, citing a left knee injury. That enabled Kerber to retake the top ranking, though Serena is assured a return to No1 in next week?s table when the points from last year?s Porsche Grand Prix drop off.The announcement comes one week after Victoria Azarenka, the former world No1 and two-time grand slam champion, announced she will return to the tour after 14-month layoff that included the birth of her son, Leo, in December.Williams? win at Melbourne Park made her the oldest player to win a major singles championship in the Open era, breaking a record she set herself last year ? and again the year before that. She has won grand slam titles in her teens (one), 20s (12) and 30s (10, more than triple the previous mark). No one could think less of Williams, now closer to 40 than 30, if she called it a career.But there?s equal if not more reason to believe Williams has unfinished business.She remains tantalizingly close to the all-time grand slam record held by Australia?s Margaret Court, whose 24 major titles were split between the amateur and professional eras. She still plays at an extraordinary high level, having won 125 of her 138 singles matches since Wimbledon 2014. And while there are no shortage of young lions on the tour, among them GarbiÃ±e Muguruza, KarolÃ­na PlÃ­?kovÃ¡ and Madison Keys, none has offered a sustained challenge of Williams? dominance the way Monica Seles swiftly ended Graf?s stranglehold on the sport.Nor would Williams be the first mother to excel on the tour.Kim Clijsters was already a borderline Hall of Famer when she retired abruptly at 23, having won the 2005 US Open and spent 19 weeks atop the women?s rankings. But the Belgian was even better after a 28-month layoff that included the birth of her daughter, winning once more at Flushing Meadows as an unseeded wild card in only her third tournament back. That made her the first mother to win a major singles title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley at Wimbledon in 1980, setting the stage for a final act that included two more grand slam titles and a return to the No1 ranking."

Microsoft's Bill Gates is the world's richest person followed by Zara's Amancio Ortega and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. The report attributed wealth inequality to aggressive wage restraint and tax dodging.","The world?s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe?s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth.In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was ?beyond grotesque? that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (Â£350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people.The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump?s victory in the US presidential election.Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives.The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation.Oxfam said the world?s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway.The others are Carlos Slim HelÃº: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service.Last year, Oxfam said the world?s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world?s population. However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF?s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an ?iron law of capitalism?, but a matter of making the right policy choices.The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, ?attesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress?.Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world?s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added.?From Brexit to the success of Donald Trump?s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,? the report said.The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: ?This year?s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. ?While one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.?Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: ?Once again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.?The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. It said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs ? a sum larger than the annual GDP of India, a country with 1.3 billion people. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 ? 182 times as much.Oxfam called for fundamental change to ensure that economies worked for everyone, not just ?a privileged few?.

The portal was hacked by a group named Team Pak Cyber Skullz, who also posted messages demanding the removal of Narendra Modi as Prime Minister. ""Freedom from the evil of the Indian Military,"" one of the posts read.","In an unfortunate series of events that unfolded in the Kashmir Valley in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan tie in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 at Edgbaston that left the neighbours' nose bloodied, pro-Kashmir elements hacked the official website of the premier National Institute of Technology (NIT) based in Srinagar on Monday, calling for an Azaad Kashmir.NIT Srinagar became a target perhaps for the fact that it had hit headlines after a clash between Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri students last year when the latter cheered India's defeat in the T20 World Cup match against West Indies. The servers were downed after the attack.While the nation was busy grappling with an early-morning terrorist attack on a CRPF station at Sumbal in Bandipora district of Kashmir, which was foiled by jawans and left four terrorists dead, pro-Kashmir freedom elements, most probably from across the border, hacked the website of the premier institute and posted, ""Ask for milk, we shall give you sweets. Ask for Kashmir we shall kill you."" This, ironically, has been the clarion call of the Right wing, which it employs towards those asking for Kashmir's freedom.""We saw that the website had been hacked when some students tried to access it to see a few articles of the syllabus. We were shocked to see that the website bore anti-India literature, anti-Indian Armed Forces propaganda and a call to leave Kashmir and give it freedom,"" one of the students told Mail Today.WHAT THE POSTERS SAID The posters, uploaded in the name of one 'All Pak Cyber Skullz Members', said. ""We shall fight till the last breath. What shall a man not pay for living? Everyday 100s of innocent people are abused, raped and even killed in Kashmir by Indian army, a third of the deaths are children. We don't want war. Take back your guns and go back to where you came from.""""All we ask is for freedom, you can kill us, you can't kill us all, we shall not give up."" The poster went on to say: ""Giving up is not an option."" In yet another poster the hackers declared their identity as 'Hacked by SH11: Team Pak Cyber Skullz'.The poster also said, ""Go Modi Go."" To a rhetorical question - ""You know why you got hacked - which the hackers obviously wanted to answer, the poster said, ""Free Kashmir. Freedom is our goal. Kashmir does not want militarised governance. Stop killing children, raping women and imprisoning the men! They just want freedom! Freedom from the evil of the Indian Military!"""

The pranksters convinced Perry that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had invented a new biofuel made using pig manure and home-brewed alcohol. Perry called the idea ""interesting,"" saying he looked forward to meeting Poroshenko. ","The US energy secretary Rick Perry has become the latest victim of a pair of Russian phone pranksters who have previously fooled Elton John into thinking he was chatting to Vladimir Putin.On this occasion, Perry believed he was discussing American coal exports with Ukraine?s prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman. In fact, he was talking to Vladimir Krasnov and Alexei Stolyarov, Russian pranksters who have become known for targeting celebrities and politicians with audacious stunts, energy department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes confirmed.Suspicions might have been raised when the 22-minute conversation turned to a claim by the pretend PM that the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko had invented a new biofuel made from home-brewed alcohol and pig manure, according to a translation reported in the Washington Post.The energy secretary ? who appeared to be relying on a translator during the conversation ? welcomed the idea as ?interesting?. He would be visiting Kiev in August, he told his caller. ?I look forward to visiting with the president and getting a more in-depth briefing ? If that?s the result, then he?s going to be a very, very wealthy and successful man.?Krasnov and Stolyarov are sometimes called the ?Jerky Boys of Russia?, named after an American duo who put out recordings of their prank phone calls in the 1990s. The pair famously made a prank call to Elton John, who thought he was speaking to the Russian president.?These individuals are known for pranking high-level officials and celebrities, particularly those who are supportive of an agenda that is not in line with their governments. In this case, the energy security of Ukraine,? Hynes said. During the call on 19 July, Perry, whose department oversees the US nuclear weapons program, discussed a range of topics, including sanctions against Russia and helping Ukraine develop oil and gas.He also said the Trump administration opposes Nord Stream 2, a Russian project to bring natural gas to Europe across the Baltic, and that US technology could help Ukraine develop gas. ?Giving Ukraine more options with some of our technology is, I think, in everyone?s best interest ? with the exception of the Russians, but that?s OK,? he said. Perry also discussed the Paris climate accord, defending Donald Trump?s decision to withdraw the US from the agreement: ?Our position is that it?s our record that should be looked at, not whether or not we have signed on to some international accord ? The president made the decision that the cost to the United States to be in the Paris accord was not in our best interests.?The call, first reported by E&E news, was recorded and posted online. It happened about a month after Perry met with a Ukrainian delegation at the energy department.Trump said last month that Washington plans to offer Ukraine more coal exports from the United States because the eastern European nation?s industrial sector has difficulty securing coal from separatist-held regions. It is unclear how the United States would bring more coal to Ukraine but Perry hinted on the call that the commerce department was working on it. ?The coal conversation at this particular point in time is with [secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross] and I full well suspect it will go forward,? he said on the call.Reuters contributed to this report.

The apartments' resident welfare society reportedly conducted a survey where 70% of the residents opted for voluntarily contributing ?1,000 to fix the road.","  Tired of waiting for the authorities to take up repairs of their damaged road,  residents of the upscale Fresco apartments in Sector 50 took the onus on themselves instead. Upset over the civic body allegedly dragging its feet in the matter, residents pooled money and got a fresh layer of concrete laid on the road.They used cold mix technology to fill the potholes, which is five times cheaper than the concrete material generally used in road repairs. Residents said the monsoon would have made entry to their residential complex an arduous affair if they had not taken this step.Cold mix asphalt is a combination of mineral aggregate and emulsified or cutback asphalt with additives.The residential society is located inside Nirvana Country and the 140-metre stretch connecting the society to the main road, was badly damaged and riddled with potholes.After the MCG allegedly refused to re-lay the road despite repeated requests, residents decided to collect money and run repairs on the stretch. The move, they said, was critical to saving their vehicles from getting damaged.?We conducted a survey among our residents using technology and the social media. We used Google forums asking residents to choose between three options ? wait for the MCG to repair the road, contribute money and repair the road or put pressure on the builder and ask them to repair the road,? Nilesh Tandon, president, RWA, Fresco apartments, said.As many as 70% of residents opted for contributing money and building the road.Based on the survey response, the RWA members did a research on the material required to lay new road and fill  the potholes. Since monsoon was approaching, using bitumen was not the solution as unless there is a proper drainage system, water accumulates on the road and the bitumen gets washed away.?We found that in the Western countries cold mix technology is used to fill potholes and this technology has also  used in the Northeast and south India. We got in touch with some organsations in Bangalore and Hyderabad who had been using this technology and took their advice. A lot of data was available on the internet and we learnt about the advantages of using cold mix,?

Many residents paid more than ?1,000. In less than a week, they collected the required money and got the work started.One bag containing 25 kg of Cold mix costs approximately?350 and 400 bags were used to fix potholes on the entire stretch of road from T-point to the Fresco entrance.?Few of our senior citizens stood and supervised the (road laying) work,?

Sasikala has also said the delay seems deliberate and hinted that as time goes by, her grip over the herded MLAs was slipping.  ","""We have waited patiently till now. Will do what is required after a point,"" grudged Sasikala, after hearing that one of AIADMK's sitting minister K Pandiarajan had jumped the ship. Saturday was not favourable for Sasikala as two MPs met caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam and joined his gang. But the big blow for the day was Jayalalithaa's loyalist K Pandiarajan, who Sasikala thought would replace Thambidurai as the messenger between the State and the Centre. All this occurred before the half day mark. ""Though Pandiarajan was expected to join Panneerselvam long time back, Sasikala's family members had persuaded him to stay back,"" stated an aide from Poes Garden. Moreover, Sasikala's camp lost a huge moral boost when Madhusudhanan, the presiding Chairman and one of the members of AIADMK from its origin went to the other side. Also Read: Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Huge blow to Chinamma as minister Pandiarajan joins OPS campAn enraged Sasikala openly stated that the delay caused by the Governor seems deliberate and hinted that as time goes by, her grip over the herded MLAs was slipping. Â But the way she framed the words to say that ""will do what is required"", it ended up more like a threat to the Governor who still hasn't called her to form the Government and less of a claim. Giving out this statement, Sasikala initiated an emergency trip to the resort where the MLAs are 'kept' accompanied by her remaining Generals, Sengottaiyan and Edapadi K Palanisamy. THE POWER PARADEInitially, she wished to go to Marina to pray at the Jayalalithaa Memorial before leaving to meet the MLAs. But the trip was cancelled as cadres and Sasikala followers could not turn up at the Memorial in such a short time. Jayalalithaa's 'Land Cruiser Prada'Â  carrying Sasikala took a different turn and left for 'Kuvathur', 83.08 km from the city to 'Golden Bay Resort', the private resort where 95 MLAs are currently herded together. Sasikala reached around 4pm and the 'meeting' began. The initial plan was to take the MLAs from the resort and to parade them in front of the Governor to prove her strength. Sasikala waited at the resort along with the MLAs patiently to acquire the Governor's appointment. ""We initiated the talks about meeting the Governor but people around Sasikala are not giving her the right advice. They did the same mistake they had done with her coronation attempt. They fix everything and then inform Governor Vidhyasagar Rao doesn't act that way and she is not Jayalalitha,"" explained a top government official. Around 6.30pm Sengottaiyan, the most important General of AIADMK came out to inform that media is falsely stating that his name is on the card for the CM post. ""Our only candidate for the post of chief minister is Chinnamma,"" he clarified. ""We have given a letter to the Governor and we will wait till tomorrow evening,"" he said explaining that the Governor has refused to meet Sasikala for the day. THE BLACKOUTSources close to the MLAs alleged that AIADMK MLAs are not happy staying inside a resort as many were not prepared for such a vacation. Also, there is a blackout of media inside the resort meaning they don't know what is going on in the world, which is why many have started to panic as well.Around 7.30pm, Sasikala left Golden Bay resort holding a 'Poker face' as any leak of expression would favour the opposite camp. Reaching Poes Garden, she met the press and assured that everything is fine with the MLAs and that they are her family and that they are together. Also Read: Sasikala losing against Panneerselvam?

Also, interestingly while Sasikala announced her plan, Chennai Police Commissioner George too released a statement. "

The police said the girl had come to Delhi from Bihar a week ago to take care of her aunt and uncle who had met with an accident.,"A 15-year-old girl was drugged and allegedly gang raped by three men in east Delhi?s New Ashok Nagar area on Friday afternoon. All the three accused in the case have been arrested.The incident took place a day after a 20-year-old woman was allegedly driven around in a car for over two hours and then raped by a driver in south Delhi?s Moti Bagh area.According to the police, the three men ? all neighbours ? allegedly barged inside the girl?s house and made her sniff chloroform, while she was in the kitchen. After she fell unconscious, the men allegedly took her to their room, where they were consuming alcohol, and then took turns to rape her.According to the police, the accused ? identified as Prashant, the landlord of the girl, Vikas and Sanjeev ?allegedly raped the 15-year-old and then dumped her in and fled.

Since they did not have any children, the girl had offered to take care of them,? a senior police officer said.The girl alleged that the incident took place when she was cooking in the kitchen and her uncle and aunt had gone to the hospital.

Ankush Verma,07-2017,Russia probe not witch hunt: Trump's FBI nominee,http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-nominee-christopher-wray-says-trump-russia-probe-is-no-witch-hunt/story-yWqVeiqefQHJctsZ0103OL.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"US President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the FBI, Christopher Wray, has rejected the President's claim that an inquiry into alleged Russian hacking of the US election is a 'witch hunt'. Adding that he will never allow the FBI to be driven by anything other than facts, Wray said he would quit if Trump asks him to do anything illegal.","Breaking with the President, the lawyer Donald Trump picked to lead the FBI declared Wednesday that he does not believe a special counsel investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign is a ?witch hunt?.Christopher Wray, the former high-ranking Justice Department official whom Trump nominated last month, also told senators at his confirmation hearing that he would never let politics get in the way of the bureau?s mission.The FBI?s work will be driven only by ?the facts, the law and the impartial pursuit of justice,? he said, asserting his independence. ?My loyalty is to the Constitution and the rule of law. They have been my guideposts throughout my career, and I will continue to adhere to them no matter the test.?Trump has repeatedly derided as a ?hoax? and a ?witch hunt? an ongoing investigation by the FBI and Robert Mueller, the former FBI director selected in May as the special counsel to oversee the probe.Wray, selected for the FBI job last month after Trump fired James Comey, made clear that he disagreed with the characterization.?I do not consider Director Mueller to be on a witch hunt,? he said under questioning from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.He pledged to lead the FBI ?without regard to any partisan political influence? and said he would consider unacceptable any efforts to interfere with Mueller?s investigation.After Trump dismissed Comey on May 9, the ex-FBI director said that the President had asked him to pledge his loyalty during a dinner at the White House months earlier. He also said Trump had encouraged him to end an investigation into the former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Wray said Trump made no demand for loyalty from him.Wray, 50, would inherit the nation?s top law enforcement agency at a particularly challenging time, given the abrupt dismissal of Comey by a president who has appeared insensitive to the bright-line boundary between the White House and the FBI.Wray?s lengthy legal career included a stint as a top Justice Department official in the Bush administration and white collar work at an international law firm with several major corporations and banks as clients. He served the government at a time when harsh interrogation techniques were approved within the Justice Department for terror suspects captured overseas, though Wray said he was never involved in signing off on those methods.Though Trump as a candidate professed support for waterboarding, Wray said he considered torture to be wrong and ineffective. ?The FBI is going to play no part in the use of any techniques of that sort.?Wray was announced as the nominee in a curt, early morning tweet by Trump, and without the pageantry of a Rose Garden ceremony. So the hearing offered the first public, close-up look at him and his background.Several senators stated that they feel he is ?the right man for the job.? Attorneys and FBI agents who have worked with him describe him as a steady hand, dedicated and low-key, seemingly impervious to political influence.An association representing the majority of FBI agents on Monday voiced its support for Wray, saying ?he understands the nature of investigative work and the centrality of special agents to the mission of the FBI.?Bill Mateja, a Dallas attorney who worked with Wray in the Justice Department, said ?he has a great moral compass and he?s no one?s minion.?Wray also faced questions about his relationships with Comey and Mueller. Trump allies have said Mueller?s closeness to Comey shows he can?t lead an unbiased probe. But Trump nominated Wray despite his having worked with both men in the Justice Department.Wray was at the department in 2004 when Comey, then the deputy attorney general, was prepared to resign during a dispute with the White House over the reauthorization of a domestic surveillance program. Wray stopped Comey in the hallway one night amid resignation rumors with a particular request, according to the 2011 book, ?The Threat Matrix.??Look, I don?t know what?s going on, but before you guys all pull the rip cords, please give me a heads-up so I can jump with you,? Wray is quoted as saying.Those who know him say that unlike the outspoken Comey, Wray would be a more reserved leader. His reserve could bode well for the agency at a time when its work has been thrust into the center of a political maelstrom.He has deep experience in Washington, having served as head of the Justice Department?s criminal division in the Bush administration, a position that had him overseeing major criminal prosecutions ? such as the special task force investigating the Enron collapse ? and also developing the US government?s legal response to terrorism and national security threats.Over the past decade, he has worked in private practice at King & Spalding in Atlanta, where he?s defended large corporations and financial institutions in criminal and civil cases.He provided legal services to Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse and fantasy sports providers DraftKings and FanDuel, among other big-name clients, according to ethics documents released Monday. If confirmed, he?ll have to step aside for a year from matters involving those clients and the law firm. He also assisted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie during the so-called Bridgegate scandal."

The victims died of bullet injuries, but villagers said police did not fire at them and alleged the involvement of supporters of the ruling TMC, reports added.","Two people were killed and many wounded in clashes that broke out during protests against  a power grid project in West Bengal?s South 24 Parganas district on Tuesday, bringing back memories of the tumultuous days of anti-land acquisition agitations in Singur and Nandigram. Both victims in Bhangar died of bullet injuries, but villagers said police did not fire at them and alleged the involvement of supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress, which blamed people ?against development? for the violence. In the previous Left regime, there was an attempt to acquire land in Bhangar, but the state government retreated in the face of fierce protests in Singur and Nandigram led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was then the opposition leader.The situation had been tense in Bhangar from Monday evening, when police picked up two activists --- before releasing them an hour later under the instructions of top officials at the state secretariat. On Tuesday morning, irate villagers vandalised police vehicles and set at least three buses on fire. They uprooted trees, blocked roads with the trunks and hurled brickbats at the police for hours. Mofijul Khan and Alam Mollah died in the firing that ensued. ?Supporters of Arabul Islam (a local TMC leader) shot my brother,? alleged Khan?s brother. CM Banerjee rushed leaders such as Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy and minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah to talk to the agitators, who demanded the cancellation of the project.The project, undertaken by the Powergrid Corporation of India, is nearing completion on a 16-acre plot that was acquired a couple of years ago. Villagers are also objecting to high-tension lines passing over their land. ?Work on the project stands suspended,? power minister Sovandeb Chatterjee told HT. Sharmistha Chowdhury, one of the leaders of the movement, said the residents gathered at the site in the morning after a huge contingent of police entered the villages of Khamar Ait, Nutanhaat and Machhibhanga. ?As the police tried to disperse the gathering by firing tear gas shells and rubber bullets, the situation went out of control,? said Chowdhury.The villagers? movement is spearheaded by Jomi, Jibika, Poribesh O Bastutantra Raksha Committee (Committee to protect land, livelihood, environment and ecosystem). The committee is guided by CPI-ML (Red Star),?a little-known Naxalite outfit. Turning the tables on Banerjee, the CPI-M came out in support of the farmers at Bhangar and threatened to hit the streets if police forces were not withdrawn. ?Police acted on the orders from the chief minister who herself had organised movements against land acquisition during the Left regime. But now she is busy organising global business summits,? said CPI-M state secretariat member Md Salim.He criticised state minister and local MLA Moollah, who was the land reforms minister during the Left regime, and said: ?Bhangar?s uncrowned king was sitting silently while tension was building up.?Echoing what the Left leaders said during their rule, Trinamool Congress vice-president and Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy said: ?Those creating disturbances are against development.??We are against land being taken away forcibly for any project,? said state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury."

Koli has been found guilty and awarded the death penalty in all the seven cases so far.On Friday, Koli was awarded the death penalty for the murder of a 12-year-old girl, who hailed from Darjeeling and had come to stay at her aunt?s house at Nithari.

Sanira Mediratta,03-2017,Infosys is 1st India-registered firm to be listed on NASDAQ,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangalore-based-software-firm-infosys-becomes-first-indian-company-to-list-on-nasdaq/1/253598.html ,"IT services major Infosys became the first India-registered company to be listed on NASDAQ on March 11, 1999. Infosys Technologies was also the first Indian company to be added to the NASDAQ-100 index, which lists 100 largest non-financial stocks in terms of market capitalisation. NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalisation.","Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies. Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income. There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe.

A large number of Saeed's supporters gathered outside the court.Saeed's counsel advocate A K Dogar was also present but the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chose to plead his case before the court.SAEED'S ARGUMENTS""The allegations levelled by the government against me had never been proved by any state institution. My organisation and I have been victimised for raising voice for freedom of Kashmir and criticising the government s weak policy on the Kashmir issue,"" Saeed said.He said that he had been placed under house in order to stop him for raising voice for Kashmiri people.Saeed appealed to the board to set aside the Punjab government's detention order.""The government detained the JuD leaders on pressure of United Nations and international organisations,"" an official representing the federal interior ministry told the board.Last Thursday, Lahore High Court division bench had questioned as why Saeed and others were not presented before a review board before the government issued notification for extension to his detention for another 90 days.THE EXTENSION OF HAFIZ SAEED'S DETENTIONOn April 30, detention of Saeed and his four aides was extended by the Punjab government for another 90 days under preventative detention under 11 EEE (I) and 11D of Anti- Terrorism Act 1997.The Punjab government on January 30 had put these five under house arrest in Lahore for their involvement in activities which can be prejudicial to peace and security.The government has also placed JuD and FIF under second schedule of the anti-terrorism act.US SANCTIONS JAMAT-UD-DAWAHThe Nawaz government had reportedly taken action against Saeed after the US clearly told Islamabad that in case of not taking action against JuD and Saeed it may face sanctions.JuD is said to be the front for the banned Lashkar-e- Taiba (LeT). The organisation has been declared as a foreign terrorist organisation by the US in June 2014.Saeed and his aides said in their petition that the government detained them without any legal justification. They said the UN resolution followed by the government did not seek detention of any citizen.""The detention of the JuD leaders is a simple case of mala fide intention and ulterior motive on part of the government as it has been done so to please India and the United States,"" the petition said.Also Read:"

""This is a petition of 2014. Every year you keep saying 'we will amend'. You said this in 2014, 15, 16 and again ... this is not the way your government runs,"" an angry CJI Khehar told the Central government's counsel.The court was hearing PILs filed by two NRIs - Shamsheer V P, an NRI from Kerala, and Nagender Chindam, Chairman of the UK-based Pravasi Bharat - seeking the voting rights. ""The US lets you vote from space. Texas laws have allowed astronauts the right to vote when on a space mission. Here, NRIs are pleading for it,"" said Chindam.Until now, due to the high cost of travel and time involved, only a minuscule population of NRIs came to India to cast vote. E-voting will allow them to vote without having to fly during elections. In e-voting, a blank postal ballot paper is emailed to the voter, who has to then fill it and mail it by post to their constituency. At a previous hearing, the government had accepted the Election Commission's (EC) view that the option of voting through an epostal ballot system could be considered for the NRIs."

In its verdict, the apex court held that though Ali was found guilty of deserting the force for a period of five days and not improving his conduct in spite of penalties imposed on him on three earlier occasions, the penalty of dismissal from service is ""excessive and harsh"" and ""in our view, the penalty of compulsory retirement would meet the ends of justice"". The bench, which also comprised Justices D Y Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, said ""indiscipline on the part of a member of an armed force has to be viewed seriously. It is clear that the respondent (Ali) had intentionally disobeyed the orders of his superiors and deserted the force for a period of 5 days. Such desertion is an act of gross misconduct and the respondent deserves to be punished suitably."" The bench directed that Ali shall be entitled for notional continuity of service till the date of completion of minimum service required to make him eligible for pension but he will not be entitled for payment of salary and allowances for that period.

The Wimbledon singles are over for another year. Garbine Muguruza is the women?s champion, while fresh-faced Roger Federer is the ruler of the men?s game again. Federer has made history again. Eight Wimbledon titles in the bag, now it?s time for him to win his 20th grand slam title. Next stop: New York. And with Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic nursing injuries, there?s maybe only one man who can stop Federer from rounding up his tally at the US Open. You know who I mean. He?s a Spaniard with a very big forehand and an obsession with perfectly ordered water bottles. Anyway, that?s all from me today. As ever, thank you for reading and emailing over the past fortnight.

Roger Federer?s name is on the trophy here. He just needs to add the final few flourishes. History beckons. His heart is beating that little bit faster as he walks to the baseline to serve. Cilic, like a condemned man heading to the gallows, takes his place, ready to return. The sun?s come out at last. Of course it has. But Federer still needs some points. He loses the first, sending a backhand long. 0-15. But he steadies himself with an accurate serve. Another one makes it 30-15 and he gees himself up with some Swiss-German. He has two championship points when Cilic screws a forehand return off to the right. Applause. Silence. A missed first serve. A rally. It?s not over yet. Cilic finds the angles to force Federer to hit a forehand long. 40-30. Federer misses another first serve. There?s only one thing for it: a second-serve ace down the middle. That?s it! Roger Federer is the Wimbledon champion again! He looks very emotional, almost in tears, but he remembers that there?s a man who?s feeling a fair bit more emotional than him right now and he walks to the net to shake hands with poor Marin Cilic. It?s all over. Federer is the owner of an historic eight Wimbledon titles and a mere 19 majors overall. Take that, Rafa.Updated

He is, however, determined to make Federer serve for it. His fifth ace of the match sets him up for a rare simple hold, even though there is the blemish of a double-fault. Federer will serve with new balls for his 19th grand slam title. ?Given this has been such an anti-climax, and is finishing so quickly, do you think they could ask Federer to knock up against one of those back-walls, so we get to see a bit more of him playing on centre court?? says David Wall. ?Even he can only have a couple more years on the tour and it?ll leave an enormous hole when he does retire.?Updated

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-4 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic sends down an ace to make it 15-0, but it?s 15-30 when he flicks a backhand wide. He challenges to no avail. Then he nets a forehand, even though Federer was stranded on the baseline. Two break points. They double up as championship points. And it really is Federer?s to lose now. Cilic wheels into another forehand ... and dumps it into that blasted net. Federer is two games away from his eighth Wimbledon title.

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 3-2 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic holds with an ace out wide. He clenches his fist, glaring at his box, resolve and steel returning. You forget athletes are humans with real emotions. The sport of tennis is so hard because you're out there all by yourself.Updated

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 2-2 Federer* (*denotes server): He?s obviously not winning this and it?s a terrible final, but I?d say Cilic has done a lot to enhance his reputation in the past few games. It would have been very easy for him to throw in the towel. But Federer?s still so miserly, scrooge-like when he?s serving. He offers Cilic false hope by letting this game drift to deuce - the drama! - but he still holds.

Third set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-6, 2-1 Federer (*denotes server): Alarm bells are ringing when Cilic spoofs a forehand into the net for 0-30. Somehow, though, he fights to 40-30, one backhand winner taking the breath away. This is gutsy from a man who is enduring some very public turmoil. Unfortunately the chap on the other side of the net is not making this any easier, making it deuce with a searing crosscourt backhand, earning a break point when Cilic nets a forehand. Admirably Cilic saves it with some serve-volley. Then he holds. This hurts, but tanking would hurt even more. ?Is this a record for unforced errors?? says Henry C. ?I feel sorry for Cilic but has got to be one of the worst finals ever. Hoping that something will change, but it is saying something when the first two sets lasted less than the Women?s final.?Updated

Third set: Cilic 3-6, 1-6, 1-1 Federer* (*denotes server): Federer lopes forward off a second serve, planting a deft backhand volley out of reach for 15-0. He holds to 15. No mercy. There?s no room for the stuff at this level.

Federer leads 15-0 when Cilic sends a forehand return wide. It?s 30-0 when he attacks a short return with a whipped forehand. Soon he has three set points.

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-5 Federer (*denotes server): Cilic is now using serve-and-volley on every point, which is enough to make you think he isn?t interested in long rallies. He?s drawn into one at 40-30, though, and he nets a forehand for deuce. Federer?s not going to give him anything now. He gives a second serve the treatment, a sweet backhand return earning him a break point. Federer can?t take it, though, knocking a return miles wide and challenging the call for absolutely no reason at all. But when Cilic sends down an 134mph serve, Federer?s flicked return brings up a second break point. Federer knocks a backhand down the line, the stretching Cilic hangs out his racket and volleys long. Federer will serve for a two-set lead. Updated

It?s not going to knock Federer off course, though, as he holds to 15. They retreat to their chairs. There?s no sign of Cilic requiring any more treatment.

Second set: Cilic* 3-6, 1-3 Federer (*denotes server): Another cheer for Cilic when he wins the first point of this game with a big serve. The game goes to 30-all. The last time I saw something like this in a grand slam final was when Sabine Lisicki collapsed emotionally in the 2013 final. It?s not clear if he?s distressed or physically hurting. But he does manage to hold to 30, keeping this final alive.Updated

Cilic pulls a backhand wide and Federer leads by a set and a break.

2.50pm BST

Second set: Cilic 3-6, 0-1 Federer* (*denotes server): The good news for Marin Cilic is that this isn?t over yet. The bad news is that Federer hasn?t lost a grand slam match from a set up since the 2014 Wimbledon final. He?s such a strong frontrunner. That?s probably why Cilic hit his chair with his racket during the changeover. He suspects this final might already be running away from him. Federer begins the set with a straightforward hold to love.Updated

Serving to stay in the set, Cilic?s pulled back to 30-all from 30-0. He decides it?s time to serve and volley, but he sets Federer up for a backhand pass, which is a bit like showing Leo Messi on to his left foot. Set point. A big serve forces Federer to return wide, but an errant forehand from Cilic brings up a second set point. Cilic is showing signs of strain. He misses a first serve. His second serve clips the top of the net and skitters wide to gift Federer the first set! That was all a bit flat.Updated

Suddenly there?s uncertainty in Cilic. From a position of dominance, it?s deuce after a double-fault, the class of Federer unsettling the Croatian. Fortunately for Cilic, Federer can?t take advantage. He holds to keep the distance between them to a single break.Updated

First set: Cilic 2-4 Federer* (*denotes server): With Federer ahead, Cilic looks to haul himself back into the set with some aggressive hitting. Federer?s backhand slice seems to head wide - it?s called out - but the umpire overrules the line judge. The point?s replayed, Federer skips into a 15-0 lead and it?s 40-0 before Cilic has time to regroup. Federer clinches his first hold to love without any problems at all in the end, but that could have been a much tougher game.

14:32

First set: Cilic* 2-3 Federer (*denotes server): Trailing 0-15, Cilic goes for a drop shot. Federer reads it. The 35-year-old springs forward to dink. Cilic hurtles forward, prods a backhand from left to right and falls heavily, leaving the court open for Federer to dab a backhand away for 0-30! That exchange seems to take the wind out of Cilic, who?s facing three break points after an awful forehand. He saves the first two, Federer?s returns drifting long. Not the third, though. Cilic doesn?t move his feet and he nets a poor backhand to hand the first break to Federer. ?Could the Prime Minister?s presence be a bad omen for fans of Roger Federer?? says David Wall. ?She?s been poison for what seemed to be sure-things in recent times.?

Federer?s second double-fault of the match makes it 30-all. Hitting deep, Cilic is starting to boss a few rallies. A penetrative backhand makes Federer net a slice, bringing up the first break point. Federer nets a first serve. He goes for a body serve with the second, though, and Cilic stiffs a backhand into the net.

A smooth serve makes it 15-all. But Cilic appears to have shaken off the nerves. He repels a big first serve and asserts himself with a huge forehand for 15-30. Sensing danger, the crowd cheers when Federer makes it 30-all at the net. The game goes to deuce after Federer?s first double-fault, but he holds. There?s a lot of nervous energy out there.

First set: Cilic* 1-0 Federer (*denotes server): Here we go, the 131st men?s singles final, with Marin Cilic serving first after Roger Federer elected to receive. It begins. Cilic sees a second serve rammed down his throat and dribbles a forehand into the net to make it 0-15. A purposeful, urgent start from Federer, while Cilic looks a little tight, slamming a forehand long to make it 15-30. The Croatian?s nervy. He?s grateful to see Federer miss a couple of backhands, but the game goes to deuce when Cilic slaps a forehand into the net. Here?s early pressure. But Cilic does well to deal with it and hold.

It?s nothing new for Federer, of course, and he looks so relaxed. He?s seen it all before. Eventually they emerge to a huge ovation. The camera doesn?t linger long on Cilic, who?s smiling slightly.

Hello. It?s interesting. If you?re actually at Wimbledon, you don?t actually have to watch a Roger Federer match to know how it?s going. You don?t even have to listen the umpire calling out the score after each point. All you need to do is stand outside Centre Court and listen to the crowd. If they?re in a state of unbridled glee verging on pure lust, if they?re oohing and aahing and panting and fawning after every point, you can safely interpret that as Federer dominance. Enthusiastic applause: Federer?s won the point. Grudging applause: the other bloke?s not playing ball.This is how it?s supposed to go. This is Federer?s kingdom, his palace from palace. There?s no desire for him to be pushed too hard. There?s no interest in an upset. Sure, it?s nice to see Federer?s opponent muster some defiance, just to keep the show going for as long as possible, but he?s not actually supposed to win. He?s supposed to be a good boy, know his place, let the master do as he pleases and lose in straight sets. You are the comedy sidekick, there to be willingly loaded into a cannon, to have a custard pie slammed in your face and raise no objections; take it, it?s all you?re good for here. This is the deal. There might be some pretence from the crowd that they?d like to see something resembling a contest, some confected jeopardy, like a tie-break in the first set, which is really about as dangerous and adventurous as splashing out on the Creuset pan instead of the John Lewis own brand (other brands are available). The Fed-lust can only stand so much risk.Centre Court, in all its stuffy blazered glory, really just wants to bask in reverie for Roger. He?s nice like Tim, but he?s even better at tennis. Andy is stubborn and pretty brilliant, so he?s an excellent alternative. Novak is mysterious and brutal, but he can be a bit bad-tempered. Rafa is sweet and amazing and Spanish, a fine young man, ever so handsome, but he isn?t an artist. None of them turn up on court wearing a cardigan or a blazer - that?s true class. None of them are Roger. They love Roger. WE LOVE YOU ROGER. I LOVE YOU ROGER. MARRY ME ROGER. Did I say that out loud? Oh, what am I like!This is what stands in front of Marin Cilic today: Federer the player and Federer the legend. He isn?t supposed to win. It?s not that the seventh seed isn?t an interesting player, of course, or incapable of playing the kind of tennis that could urinate all over the eagerly anticipated Swiss coronation. It?s just that he isn?t Roger. Nor is the former US Open champion much of a character, a card. He?s just a guy who?s good at tennis. Unlike Goran Ivanisevic, the last Croatian man to win Wimbledon, there?s no Good Marin, Bad Marin and Emergency Marin. There?s just Marin. It might not be enough to win their affections.It could be enough to win this final, though. Cilic is playing excellent grass-court tennis this year and he crushed Federer on the way to winning the US Open in 2014. At his best, shorn of nerves and anxiety, he is a mighty proposition. If the 28-year-old doesn?t freeze, he could do something here. He was two sets up against Federer in their quarter-final last year. Underestimate him at your peril. But for all that it has been possible to catch a few signs of Federer frailty over the past fortnight, he still won that match and he still hasn?t really come close to dropping a set at this tournament. And last year he had that knee injury. This time he?s well rested, having worked out how best to protect his physical resources after that knee injury, and he?s been untouchable this year, playing quick, sharp-shooting, ask-no-questions tennis that is intended to kill the argument as quickly as possible. It?s brought him another Australian Open title, his 18th major, and titles in Miami and Indian Wells. It could bring him an historic eighth Wimbledon title.This is Cilic?s second grand slam final. It?s Federer?s 11th here and his 29th overall. He?s 36 in less than a month. This isn?t normal. But he isn?t normal. You wonder when it?s going to end. Is it going to end? You know what they want on Centre Court. More Roger. They can?t get enough Roger. And do you know? It?s because there?s nothing else quite like it.Play begins at: 2pm BST.Updated

Dishant Sharma,07-2017,Sania Mirza's ex-partner wins Wimbledon mixed doubles,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/16/jamie-murray-martina-hingis-heather-watson-wimbledon-mixed-doubles-final?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Indian tennis player Sania Mirza's former women's doubles partner Switzerland's Martina Hingis won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title alongside Andy Murray's brother Jamie Murray on Sunday. The British-Swiss duo defeated defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen. This was Murray's fourth Grand Slam title, while Hingis registered her 23rd Grand Slam title triumph.","Jamie Murray ensured the family name will be on a Wimbledon trophy for the third time in five years as he and the former world No1 Martina Hingis beat the defending champions Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen of Finland 6-4, 6-4 to win the mixed doubles crown.After the painful end to Andy Murray?s title defence, it was left to Jamie to produce the goods and he and Hingis, the No1 seeds, duly clinched victory in 74 minutes.?I have to thank Martina for asking me as I wasn?t going to play mixed doubles,? Murray said. ?When she texted me, it was an easy decision to play, she?s such a great player. Anyone in the locker room would have jumped at the chance to play with her. I really enjoyed the whole week. It?s a great achievement. Any time you win a grand slam, get your name up on the board again, it?s there forever. No one will take it away from you.?Andy Murray, notoriously nervous when watching his brother play, was lurking in the locker room during the match but was there to congratulate him soon after he came off court. ?I just saw him there,? Jamie said. ?He said he came in the middle of the first set. I think he just waited in the lockers. He said he didn?t watch it. I don?t know if he snuck a few points in or not.?With Murray and Watson on opposite sides of the net, it was a win-win situation for British fans on Centre Court, most of whom had stuck around after seeing Roger Federer clinch a record eighth singles title earlier in the day. And they were rewarded with a match full of power, angles, deft volleys and outstanding movement around the net, especially from Murray, whose net skills left the crowd gasping atÂ times.Hingis was the runner-up to Kontinen and Watson last year alongside Leander Paes but when she dumped the Indian in favour of Murray, the Scot knew he had a great chance to add to his grand slam tally. Ten years after partnering Jelena Jankovic to victory here, this was his fourth grand slam crown in all while Hingis took her total to 23, five singles, 12 women?s doubles and six mixed, five of which have come since the beginning of 2015.The big-hitting Kontinen, the men?s doubles world No1, had his moments and Watson held her own but last year?s champions were always up against it with Hingis?s dipping returns perfectly complementing Murray?s sharp net play. After trading early breaks, Watson was broken for the second time at 3-3 and they closed out the opening set.Kontinen and Watson had two chances to break the Murray serve at 3-2 up in the second set but could not take them. A slightly mis-hit return from Hingis set up two break points for the top seeds on the Watson serve at 3-3 and they took the second to get the vital break as Watson hit a forehand into the net. After Hingis held to love, the pair saved three break points to serve out for the title.Kontinen said he and Watson had not taken their chances but they hope to team up again next year. Murray and Hingis have yet to discuss future plans but it seems likely they will defend their title next summer and they may even play together in the US Open later this summer.Hingis, who won the singles here 20 years ago, admitted she was ?not used to no? when she asks someone to play mixed doubles. ?Here, it?s always tough,? she said. ?I understand in the past guys would have said no because they really want to focus on doubles only because it?s three?out-of-five [sets]. This is the only tournament that still does it. It?s definitely easier to ask somebody at the other three grand slams and not Wimbledon. But I was definitely hoping for a yes.?As Jamie said: ?It was a good decision by both of us.?"

Saraswatis book ""Satyarth Prakash"" had a deep impact on Ramdev. While greeting someone over phone, Ramdev never says hello. Instead he chants Om. The first chapter of ""Satyarth Prakash"" explains the etymology and significance of Om. After reading the book, Ramdev wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages. As the path of ancient sages also meant practice of celibacy, so he took a vow - to never marry. A new book ""The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market"" by Kaushik Deka has these nuggets of information. ""Satyarth Prakash"" was written in Hindi in 1875 by the renowned religious and social reformer and the founder of Arya Samaj. The book formed the intellectual core and social, political and economic philosophy of the yoga guru. It was a book primarily explaining the true tenets of Hinduism, making an appeal for one uniform religion based on the principles of the Vedas. ""This book was a revelation to me. It awakened my inner- self, gave me a sense of purpose in life. It introduced me to the wisdom of our ancestors. I wanted to follow the path shown by the ancient sages,"" Ramdev is quoted as saying. ""Satyarth Prakash"" not only changed Ramdevs life but also gave it a direction and purpose. ""He was so moved by the writings of Dayanand Saraswati that he quit the government school where the curriculum was a leftover of the education policy introduced by British politician Babington Macaulay (1800?59), who was instrumental in the introduction of English as the medium of instruction for higher education in India. ""He knew his parents would never agree to his decision of quitting regular school, where he was doing exceptionally well. So one fine day he fled from home and enrolled himself in a gurukul, a traditional educational institute based on Vedic principles, at Khanpur in Haryana,"" Deka writes. Ramdev was the brightest student in the government primary school, located in the village, where he studied till the class V. For higher classes he moved to the Shahbajpur High School, a few kilometres away. ""I used to buy second-hand books, yet I always topped my class,"" claims Ramdev. ""Dayanandji made me realise the value of the treasure trove hidden in Vedic education. Its a progressive approach based on tark (logic), tathya (facts), yukti (argument) and praman (evidence). The goal of British education system was to enslave our mind and curb free and logical thinking,"" he says. ""The Baba Ramdev Phenomenon: From Moksha to Market"", published by Rupa, offers a detailed account of Ramdevs journey from attaining moksha in the Himalayas to ruling the market, especially the FMCG sector, with his Patanjali products. It captures the rise and rise of Patanjali and the various factors that worked for it, most importantly, the vision of Ramdev and the assistance of his associate Acharya Balkrishna. "

A division bench of Justice V M Kanade and Justice A M Badar were hearing a petition moved by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, which is in charge of constructing the rail link between Colaba and SEEPZ in Andheri, and told those opposing that ""there was a need for Metro. The traffic in Mumbai is becoming bad to worse.""The bench was reacting to the statement made by an advocate representing those opposed to cutting down of trees in the city. The advocate said that there can be no underground construction that can be carried out in Coastal Regulation Zone 3 areas. Justice Kanade said, ""Metro should've been in Mumbai 30 years ago. You (the government) are doing it 30 years later."" He also added that there was a need to maintain balance between environment and ground reality. The court said that thousands of people travelled between north and south Mumbai each day by local trains. Many die in trains while several others die in road accidents. ""The Metro III project will prove very useful for these people so everyone should first consider the ground situation,"" Justice Kanade said.The corporation needs to cut 108 trees to construct two stations including the Bandra Kurla Complex station. A lawyer for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation told the court they had ""taken loans from Japan for the contruction of Metro rail and each delay over tree cutting was causing huge losses"". They added that they were ready to replant 4000 trees to compensate for the 108 trees they were going to uproot."

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) initially wanted Mumbai to host India's home matches but later asked FIFA to shift them to Delhi due to pressure from the sports ministry as it felt it was appropriate that the capital hosts the home teams games. Asked if they have finalised on shifting India's round robin matches from Mumbai to Delhi, FIFAs head of events Jaime Yarza told PTI, ""We are working on the most beneficial decision for the tournament. We take the requests from the Indian Government very seriously, as its our main partner in the organisation of the FIFA U-17 World Cup."" As hosts, India would normally be placed in Group A and will be the number one team - A1 - in the four-team group.

Ayushi Ahluwalia,07-2017,I am a creation of this Parliament: Prez Pranab Mukherjee,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-pranab-mukherjee-hails-democracy-parliament-in-his-farewell-speech/story-8TYPtKytLvys3F0lgyUm2J.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"During his farewell speech on Sunday, outgoing President Pranab Mukherjee said that he was a creation of the Parliament. ""The Parliament gave a direction to my political vision as I got to learn a lot from the serious discussions held in both Houses of the Parliament,"" he added. Notably, the first parliamentary session he attended was on July 22, 1969.","President Pranab Mukherjee hailed on Sunday India?s democracy and Parliament in particular, delivering an emotional farewell speech at the Central Hall where he urged lawmakers to ?debate, discuss and dissent? but not disrupt. (President?s speech: Full text)Mukherjee, the 13th President of India, will leave the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Tuesday when his successor Ram Nath Kovind is sworn in.?I strived to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, not just in word but also in spirit,? Mukherjee said, reflecting upon his time as India?s titular head of state that began in 2012.The President has raised eyebrows last year when he ordered the dismissal of the Uttarakhand government.Mukherjee spent 37 years as a Congress member in Parliament, where, he said on Sunday, ?realised how disruption hurts the opposition more than the government as it denies them the opportunity to raise the concerns of the people,? the President said.The monsoon session of Parliament currently underway has seen repeated adjournments, costing of time and money for the House. Both Houses of Parliament have often been marred by protests that have delayed the rollout of key legislation.?When Parliament fails to discharge its lawmaking role or enacts laws without discussion, I feel it breaches the trust reposed in it by the people of this great country,? he said.In addition to disruptions, the President spoke out about Ordinances in particular, calling it a tool that ?should be used only in compelling circumstances?.Mukherjee shared a story about his mentor, late PM Indira Gandhi, on the importance of ?self-correction?. After the Congress?s poll defeat following the Emergency, Gandhi and Mukherjee were in London in 1978 and faced journalists, he said. ?The first question that was flung at her was, ?What have been your gains from the Emergency?? Looking at the journalist squarely in the eye, Indira Gandhi replied, ?In those 21 months, we comprehensively managed to alienate all sections of Indian people.? I learnt an early lesson of acknowledging my mistakes and rectifying them. Self-correction in such situations is always a better option than self-justification,? Mukherjee said.Earlier, vice president Hamid Ansari recalled how Mukherjee spoke about nurturing pluralism and diversity. He quoted Mukherjee to add that there is room for Argumentative Indian but not intolerant Indian. Ansari said ?these messages are important in our troubled times?. The President too, spoke about the diversity of the country of 130 crore people who, he said, belonged to three major ethnic groups, practicing seven major religions and speaking 122 languages in daily lives.?Not a single part of this vast territory of 3.3 million square kilometers of landmass and islands is unrepresented in the Parliament. Each of the 788 voices of MPs is important,? said Mukherjee. His comment assumes significance in the wake of the rise of smaller parties in Parliament.Mukherjee spoke about his association with PV Narsimha Rao, remember former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee for his oration, Manmohan Singh for his ?calming presence?, and recalled how LK Advani gave him mature advice and Sonia Gandhi was a passionate supporter of social legislations.In the closing parts of his speech, he praised Prime Minister Modi and said: ?I?ll carry with me fond memories of association with PM Narendra Modi and remember his warm behaviour towards me?. He praised the PM for advice and co-operation ?at every step? and added that the BJP leader is working ?with passion and energy, he is driving transformational changes.??It will be with a tinge of sadness and a rainbow of memories that I will be leaving this building today... I leave with a sense of fulfilment and happiness of having served the country,? he said, before finishing his speech with ?Jai Hind?.Mukherjee will address the nation tomorrow before he demits office."
Dishant Sharma,01-2017,Penalty shootouts to decide Group-stage matches in FIFA WC,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/10/fifa-vote-expand-world-cup-48-teams-from-2026?CMP=share_btn_tw ,"FIFA on Tuesday announced that penalty shootouts will be used to decide drawn matches between teams in the group stages of the FIFA World Cup, which shall feature 48 teams from the 2026 edition onwards. The move is aimed at minimising the risk of teams colluding in their final group games to eliminate others from the tournament.","The Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, has robustly defended the decision to expand the World Cup from 32 competing national teams to 48, which will begin with the 2026 tournament, in the face of immediate criticism from top European clubs. At a meeting in Zurich, Fifa?s rule-making council unanimously passed the new format, which will create a first round of 16 groups, from which two of three teams will qualify and proceed to a knockout competition beginning with 32 countries.Fifa has projected that the increase to 48 countries will generate around $1bn more income, and $640m profit, from greater television rights and sponsorship. Infantino said the money will be reinvested in football; he has promised all Fifa?s 211 member countries? associations $5m a year to aid development.Speaking after the meeting, Infantino argued that the expanded tournament will increase interest in football worldwide by involving more countries, while not burdening players with more matches.Responding robustly to criticism from the German football association (DFB) and European Club Association (ECA), which derided Fifa?s decision as having been taken for ?political reasons rather than sporting ones,? Infantino said: ?We are in the 21st century, and we should shape the World Cup for the 21st century. Football is more than Europe and South America; football is global.?Fifa?s football associations, particularly in Africa and Asia, have historically been in favour of the tournament?s expansion, which Infantino said will give them all more places in the finals. Precise numbers are yet to be decided, as are some of the format?s details, including whether drawn first-round group matches could all be decided on penalties. The host for the 2026 tournament is due to be considered in 2020, with a bid featuring the US, either on its own or in conjunction with one or both of Canada and Mexico, the overwhelming favourite.Arguing that qualification for the World Cup provides a key boost to football development in smaller countries, Infantino pointed to the advances of Iceland, Wales and Hungary in last year?s European Championship as examples of ?beautiful stories?. European football?s governing body, Uefa, decided in 2008 to expand its tournament from 16 countries to 24, and Europe?s representatives on Fifa?s council supported the World Cup increase, despite the opposition from leading clubs.In a statement the ECA, which has 220 member clubs in 53 European countries, said that the 32 team format is ?a perfect formula? and suggested that Infantino had in mind electoral support from Fifa?s member associations, which each vote for for the president. Questioning the ?urgency? with which so historic a decision was taken, less than a year since Infantino was elected, the ECA said ?stakeholders? who will be ?impacted? had not been properly involved.?We understand that this decision has been taken based on political reasons rather than sporting ones and under considerable political pressure, something ECA believes is regrettable,? the statement said.Infantino declined to respond to reports immediately after Fifa?s announcement that the Spanish football league, La Liga, which claimed it was not consulted at all, is considering a lawsuit. Last week the DFB president, Reinhard Grindel, expressed ?immense reservations? about the proposed expansion, arguing that allowing 16 more countries to qualify would reduce the quality of the football.Referring to his election last February on a proposal to expand the World Cup to 40 teams, Infantino said the prime objection from European clubs had been to increasing the number of matches played, and the tournament?s length. He said Fifa administrators had since examined four different formats and found that the 48-team expansion could address those concerns.The immediate move to a 32-team knockout competition after the two matches played by each country in the first round of 16 groups, means the finalists will have played seven games, the same as in the current format. The tournament can still be played over 32 days, as it is now. Infantino pointed out that Uefa?s expansion lengthened the European Championship by a week, and incorporated one more match for the finalists.Arguing that the quality of football is improving around the world, and pointing to the elimination of both England and Italy by Costa Rica in the last World Cup in 2014, Infantino said: ?Increasing the size of teams which can participate will increase the investment in football development, to make sure that the teams can qualify.?The FA?s chief executive, Martin Glenn, had said his preference was ?to keep the tournament smaller,? but he acknowledged that ?smaller countries understandably want to be part of the tournament.? The English representative on the Fifa council, David Gill, did not attend the meeting because of a previously arranged visit to Australia, but given the strength of support for the expansion, he had been expected to vote in favour.In a statement after the decision, the FA said: ?We will work with Uefa, Fifa and the other European associations to understand how the 48-team Fifa World Cup will work. The priority has to be consideration of the potential impact on fans, players, teams and leagues, and also recognition of the importance of sporting integrity and commercial viability.?"

While the Kalkaji station will feature artwork linked to Lotus and ISKCON temples, the IIT and Jamia stations will have artwork based on education and struggle of students. A mountain and peacock theme was chosen for the airport station.","Delhi Metro?s upcoming Magenta line will be a visual treat for commuters as artwork will adorn four stations ?Jamia Millia Islamia, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and Terminal 1D of Indira Gandhi International Airport. Taking a cue from the Heritage Line, the theme of the artwork on these stations on the Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden corridor will be based on the salient features of the neighbourhoods. For instance, the artwork at Jamia Millia Islamia will depict photos of the values of the university, education, art and learning. The Magenta line will connect education hubs such as Jamia Milia Islamia and IIT-Delhi. The line is likely to be operational by September. Battling land acquisition issues, the project had missed its December 2016 deadline. The corridors of IIT will be decorated with artefacts depicting the struggle of students in coping up with the ever-changing technologies.The corridors of IIT will be decorated with artefacts depicting the struggle of students in coping with new technologies.At the Kalkaji station, the walls will be decorated with paintings and artefacts of the Lotus and ISKCON temples. The one at IGI airport will showcase Delhi?s hilly areas and the national bird, peacock, said a senior official of Delhi metro. ?The theme of mountain and peacock was chosen for the airport station because it is near the ridge area,? he said. Stations on the short 5.17-km Heritage line also has three-dimensional (3D) panels that depict the glory of the bygone era at the Delhi Gate, Jama Masjid, Lal Quila and Kashmere Gate stations. The life-size artwork and walls decorated with paintings showcasing India?s history during the Mughal era was were well received by commuters. So the metro has decided to carry forward the concept in other stations also, he said. Other stations such as INA, Govindpuri, Green Park and Jangpura, also have artworks on the walls.?Having tied up with various government bodies/organisations such as the National Book Trust, Delhi Tourism, Sahitya Akademi, India Habitat Centre and the textile ministry, DMRC is enhancing the overall commuting experience,? he said.At the Kalkaji station, the walls will be decorated with paintings and artefacts of the Lotus and ISKCON temples. Trials between Botanical Garden in Noida and Kalkaji Mandir (13 kilometres) in Delhi had started on October 27 last year while dummy runs between Terminal 1-IGI airport and Janakpuri west (10KM) began on December 21. This section from Botanical Garden till Kalkaji Mandir, which will be opened in next two months, consists of nine elevated stations ? Botanical Garden, Okhla Bird sanctuary, Kalindi Kunj, Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh, Okhla Vihar, Jamia Milia Islamia, Sukhdev Vihar, Okhla NSIC and Kalkaji Mandir.

He talked about the various professionals of India, and how they act as nation builders. He also said that India has believed in the philosophy of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - the World is My Family"". ","Ram Nath Kovind was sworn in as the 14th President of India in the Central Hall of Parliament on Tuesday. The following is the full text of the speech delivered by him.""Respected Shri Pranab Mukherjee ji,Shri Hamid Ansari ji,Shri Narendra Modi ji,Shrimati Sumitra Mahajan ji,Shri Justice J. S. Khehar ji,Excellencies,Honourable Members of Parliament,Ladies and Gentlemen, andFellow CitizensI thank you for electing me to the responsibility of the President of India, and I enter this office with all humility. Coming here to Central Hall has brought back so many memories. I have been a Member of Parliament and here, in this very Central Hall, have had discussions with many of you. Often we agreed, sometimes we disagreed. But we learnt to respect each other. And that is the beauty of democracy.I grew up in a mud house, in a small village. My journey has been a long one, and yet this journey is hardly mine alone. It is so telling of our nation and our society also. For all its problems, it follows that basic mantra given to us in the Preamble to the Constitution - of ensuring Justice, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity and I will always continue to follow this basic mantra.I bow to the 125 crore citizens of this great nation and promise to stay true to the trust they have bestowed on me. I am conscious I am following in the footsteps of stalwarts such as Dr. Rajendra Prasad, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, and my immediate predecessor, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, whom we address out of affection as Pranab Da.Our Independence was the result of efforts by thousands of patriotic freedom fighters led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, Sardar Patel integrated our nation. Principal architect of our Constitution Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar instilled in us the value of human dignity and of the republican ethic.These leaders did not believe that simply political freedom was enough. For them, it was crucial to also achieve economic and social freedom for millions of our people.We would be completing 70 years of our Independence soon. We are also well into the second decade of the 21st century, a century that so many of us intuitively believe will be an Indian century, guided and shaped by India and its accomplishments. We need to build an India that is an economic leader as well as a moral exemplar. For us, those two touchstones can never be separate. They are and must forever be linked.The key to India's success is its diversity. Our diversity is the core that makes us so unique. In this land we find a mix of states and regions, religions, languages, cultures, lifestyles and much more. We are so different and yet so similar and united.The India of the 21st century will be one that is in conformity with our ancient values as well as compliant with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There is no dichotomy there, no question of choice. We must combine tradition and technology, the wisdom of an age-old Bharat and the science of a contemporary India.As the gram panchayat must determine our consultative and community based problem solving, the Digital Republic must help us leapfrog developmental milestones. These are the twin pillars of our national endeavour.Nations are not built by governments alone. The government can at best be a facilitator, and a trigger for society's innate entrepreneurial and creative instincts. Nation building requires national pride:- We take pride in the soil and water of India;- We take pride in the diversity, religious harmony and inclusive ethos of India;- We take pride in the culture, heritage and spirituality of India;- We take pride in our fellow citizens;- We take pride in our work; and- We take pride in the little things we do every day.Each citizen of India is a nation builder. Each one of us is a custodian of India's well-being and of the legacy that we will pass on to coming generations.- The armed forces that protect our borders and keep us safe are nation builders.- Those police and paramilitary forces that fight terrorism and crime are nation builders.- That farmer toiling in the blazing sun to feed fellow citizens is a nation builder. And we must never forget that so much of our farm labour comprisesÂ  women.- That scientist concentrating tirelessly and 24 x 7 to send an Indian space mission to Mars, or invent a vaccine, is a nation builder.- That nurse or doctor helping the sick to recover and fighting disease in a remote village, is a nation builder.- That young person who founds a start-up and becomes a job creator is a nation builder. The start-up could be on a small farm, converting mangoes to pickles. Or in an artisans' village, weaving carpets. Or at a laboratory lit up by giant screens.- That tribal and ordinary citizen striving to preserve our ecology, our forests, our wildlife, to push back climate change and to advance the cause of renewable energy, is a nation builder.- That committed and driven public servant who works beyond the call of duty, whether on a flooded road, directing traffic; or in a quiet room, poring over detailed files, is a nation builder.- That self-less teacher who equips young children and shapes their destinies, is a nation builder.- Those countless women who take care of families with so many other responsibilities, at home and work, and raise children to become ideal citizens, are nation builders.People elect their representatives from the Gram Panchayat to Parliament. They vest their will and hopes in these representatives. In turn, the people's representatives devote their lives to the service of nation.But, our endeavours are not for ourselves alone. Down the ages, India has believed in the philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - the World is My Family. It is appropriate that the land of Lord Buddha should lead the world in its search for peace, tranquility and ecological balance.India's voice counts in today's world. The entire planet is drawn to Indian culture and soft power. The global community looks to us for solutions to international problems - whether terrorism, money laundering or climate change. In a globalised world, our responsibilities are also global.This links us to our global family, our friends and partners abroad, and our diaspora, that contributes in so many ways across the world. It brings us to the support of other nations, whether by extending the umbrella of the International Solar Alliance or being first respondents following natural disasters.We have achieved a lot as a nation, but the effort to do more, to do better and to do faster should be relentless. This is especially so as we approach the 75th Year of our independence in 2022. What must also bother us is our ability to enhance access and opportunity for the last person and the last girl-child from an under-privileged family if I may put it so, in the last house in the last village. This must include a quick and affordable justice delivery system in all judicial forums.The citizens of this country are the real source of strength to me.I am confident that they will continue to give me the energy to serve the nation.We need to sculpt a robust, high growth economy, an educated, ethical and shared community, and an egalitarian society, as envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi and Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji. These are integral to our sense of humanism. This is the India of our dreams, an India that will provide equality of opportunities. This will be the India of the 21st century.Thank you very much!Jai HindVande Mataram"" Also Read:Ram Nath Kovind sworn in as India's 14th President; accept role with humility, he saysAll you need to know about Ram Nath Kovind, 14th President of India15 initiatives President Pranab Mukherjee will always be remembered forRam Nath Kovind set to enter Rashtrapati Bhavan: All about 340-room Raisina Hill palaceBJP's presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind: An ardent dog lover"

Airoli and Vikhroli, among twelve unique mangrove forests in India. The twelve locations were selected to help conserve different mangrove species, and establish them as international tourism destinations, officials said. ""Mangrove forests can sequester carbon 10 times more than tropical forests,"" they added."," The Mangrove Society of India (MSI) has put two of Mumbai region?s mangroves   ? Airoli and Vikhroli wetlands ? among 12 unique mangrove forests in the country.Mangrove forests grow in creeks, estuaries, bays and lagoons and in inter-tidal areas ? area between the high tide and the low tide. Their ecosystem is believed to have evolved around 114 million years back in tropical and subtropical regions and India  has 3% (4,740 sq km) of the world?s mangrove cover. The unique mangroves located along India?s 7,516-km coastline are in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The world?s largest mangrove forests in Sunderbans, West Bengal, are also featured in the list. The list was released by the MSI and the Goa state biodiversity board  at the National Mangrove Conference in Dona Paula, Goa last week. Maharashtra is the only state to have a dedicated cell protecting its mangrove cover.?Mangroves are under threat from developmental projects and we are failing to understand the value of safeguarding the coastline from disasters and their economic value when it comes to tourism. We do not have the concept of preservation in India,? said Arvind Untawale, secretary, MSI. ?The idea behind selecting these 12 locations is to enhance conservation and protection of different mangrove species, the biodiversity and establish them as international tourism destinations.?He added that tigers in Sunderbans, saltwater crocodiles in Odisha, and birds, fish, crabs, and the unique flora present in this ecosystem are not getting enough attention from the Centre. ?There is great potential for adventure, research, information, conservation and management aspects, which the tourism sector needs to focus upon,? said Untawale.Mangroves in?Vikhroli.

						?What most people are unaware of is that India is home to a maximum number of flora and fauna species in the world,? said Dr K Kathiresan, former dean and director, Annamalai University and from the Centre of Advanced Study in Marine Biology. He added that of the total 4,060 species living in India?s mangroves, 969 are floral species, accounting for 24% of the biodiversity and the rest 3,091 are faunal species. ?Mangrove forests can sequester carbon 10 times more than tropical forests and carbon storage is four times more than tropical, temperate or boreal forests (coniferous forests),? said Dr Kathiresan.Experts said the tourism potential of mangroves in India, unlike many other countries in the world, is underexplored. ?We have to develop such spots for people to realise its importance. Tourism spots will not only help boost revenue but even their protection,? said N Vasudevan, additional principal chief conservator of forest, Maharashtra state mangrove cell. SAVING THE NATURAL COAST GUARDS While India has 3% of the world?s mangrove cover, environmentalists believe they are under threat from developmental projects. Here are the 12 unique mangrove forest locations selected for better conservation:Gulf of Kutch, GujaratEstablished in 1980 and 1982, the Gulf of Kutch Marine National Park (163 sq km) and Marine Sanctuary (295 sq km) are mangrove forests spread across 42 islands with rich marine and mangrove biodiversity. They are accessible from Jamnagar by boats that travel 10km to reach these areas. Vikhroli mangroves, MumbaiIt is one of the largest (2000ha) private mangrove forests in the country. More than 16 mangrove species, 82 butterfly species, 208 bird species, 13 crab species, 7 prawn species, 20 fish species and mammals like jackals, wild boards, mongoose, otters and leopards can be spotted at the mangrove ecosystem.Mangrove and Marine Biodiversity Centre, Airoli, Navi MumbaiThe centre, a pet project of the Maharashtra state mangrove cell, was completed and opened for public earlier this year. It is surrounded by a flamingo sanctuary that is spread over 1,690 ha, which includes 896 ha of mangroves and 794 ha of land adjacent to a water body, to safeguard more than 50,000 flamingos visiting every year.Achra, Maharashtra The mangroves near the fishing village of Achra are considered sacred.

						Located near the fishing village of Achra, almost 30km away from Kankavli on the Mumbai-Goa highway, this is the most dense mangrove spot in the Konkan region. Here, the mangroves are considered sacred as the entire area is owned by Rameshwar temple trust. Dr Salim Ali Mangrove Sanctuary, GoaEstablished in 1982, a 250-hectare mangrove patch at Chodan, located very close to Panjim, is home to 16 mangrove species, more than 100 birds and large intertidal fauna. The area has boat facilities, walkways and observation towers for a closer look at the salt-tolerant plants.Kali Nadi, Karnataka With the Western Ghats in the background, the lush green mangrove cover along the Devbagh creek of the Kali Nadi estuary near Karwar, Karnataka, is considered the most sacred mangrove forests of the state. Kannur, Kerala Situated along the famous Kerala backwaters and not very far from Kochi, large portions (587 ha) of the Kannur mangrove forest were recently declared as reserved forests (highest protection status) after a significant mangrove cover was lost owing to developmental projects. However, several parts were restored by the forest department with man-made mangrove patches that cater to both marine and intertidal biodiversity.Pichavaram and Muthupet, Tamil NaduTwo mangrove spots along the Tamil Nadu coastline ? Pichavaran near Chidambaram and Muthupet near Pulicat Lake ? are fed with Vellary estuary waters and are rich in mangrove biodiversity.

The two aircraft had reportedly come face-to-face with barely 40 metres between them on the same taxiway. ","The Air Traffic Controller inadvertently gave instructions to one aircraft to continue taxiing through a particular taxiway mixing its location with that of another plane that led to a near collision at Delhi airport on Tuesday, according to AAI.In a major safety lapse, two aircraft of IndiGo and SpiceJet came face-to-face barely 40 metres away on the same taxiway on Tuesday but providentially a disaster was averted after commanders of both the planes alerted the air traffic control and switched off their engines.Following the incident, the air traffic controller has been derostered pending investigation.While acknowledging that an air traffic controller mixed the locations of the two flights, AAI (Airports Authority of India) on Wednesday also said SpiceJet flight did not question the incomplete ATC instruction for taxiing, adding that these human errors resulted in ?traffic conflict situation?.In a detailed statement, AAI said IndiGo flight (6E-769) from Lucknow to Delhi after landing on runway-28 was taxiing via taxiway ?E2? for parking stand 12 as advised by ATC.Read: Air traffic controller ?forgot? it had sent aircraft for refuellingThe departing flight of SpiceJet (SG123) was not able to take off from runway 28 due to poor visibility and waiting to return to apron for parking, it said.Accordingly, the controller instructed SG123 to taxi via taxiway C and hold short of the taxiway ?E2? so that the two flights were not in conflict with each other.?The traffic density being high and complex, the controller inadvertently gave instructions to SG123 to continue taxi via E to stand 130, mixing its location with the location of SG263 which was holding on another taxiway ?E? for departure.?However, SG123 also did not question the incomplete ATC instruction for taxiing. These human errors resulted into traffic conflict situation. However, both aircraft stopped at safe distance and there was no risk to aircraft or passengers,? AAI said.Noting that the statement is being issued to avoid any fear among air passengers after yesterday?s incident, AAI said at times it may not be possible to eliminate human error.?At times it may not be possible to eliminate human error whether it is aviation or other industries but continuous efforts are being made by AAI to offset such human errors through Standard Operating Procedures, recurrent training to the controllers and introducing technology,? it said.Further, AAI said various reports appearing in the media are giving exaggerated version stating that the passengers had close shave, indicating a distorted interpretation that may create fear in the minds of air passengers.Safety record of ATC provided by AAI at Indian airports has been very good and comparable to best in the world, it added.

According to a source, MCPCR officials will be submitting a detailed report about the incident to the woman and child ministry of the Maharashtra Government. In addition, MCPCR officials would also be putting forth certain recommendations on the basis of their visit, for the betterment of development of the children in the jail.There are 285 woman inmates at Byculla Jail and 17 children below the age of six live with their mothers in the same barracks with other inmates. ?We would recommend that inmates who have to live with their children should be kept in a separate barrack all together, so that the children aren?t affected mentally and do not develop criminal minds,? said Ghughe. Mukerjea, along with 200 inmates, have been booked under the sections of rioting and mischief by fire. As after the news of Shetye?s death broke out, the woman inmates rose in protest. The inmates damaged jail property and as a mark of protest, they even went up to the prison roof and burnt clothes and newspapers.

The battery is said to be of a lower capacity -- about 3000mAh, and if Samsung is redesigning the chassis, it might not support a dual curved screen. But it will be called refurbished and the price expected should be considerably cheaper."

He added, ""Since right to privacy consists of diverse aspects and it is a sub-specie of liberty, every aspect of the sub-species will not qualify as a fundamental right."" ","Arguing in the right to privacy case before the nine-judge Constitution bench in Supreme Court today, Attorney General K K Venugopal said that privacy does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right. ""Privacy is part of Right to Life under Article 21, but does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right,"" said AG Venugopal on behalf of the Centre. The debate on privacy as a fundamental right is a part of the larger debate on Aadhaar and if the scheme violates one's right to privacy.The Centre has earlier said that petitions challenging the validity of Aadhaar over violation of privacy cannot be entertained under Article 21. ATTORNEY GENERAL MOUNTS DEFENCEArguing for the Centre, AG Venugopal said that framers of the Constitution intentionally omitted mention of privacy as a fundamental right. There are several aspects to Right to Life such as right to food, shelter and employment but everything does not enjoy the status of a fundamental right, said K K Venugopal in the Supreme Court today. The Attorney General said that there is no absolute Right to Life and deprivation of the right in certain instances is in-built in the Constitution. He said that while life and liberty are qualified rights under the Constitution but their every aspect is not a fundamental right and it cannot be elevated to that status. Petitioners want privacy on a whole to be declared as a fundamental right but it will have grave consequences, argued Attorney General Venugopal. He said that a World Bank report has identified Aadhaar as a great scheme for developing countries.THREE STATES SUPPORT PETITIONERSKapil Sibal, appearing for the states Karnataka, West Bengal and Puducherry, told the nine-judge bench headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar that the states support the petitioners on the argument that privacy is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Kapil Sibal said that while privacy is not mentioned in the Constitution of America and Australia but it is a fundamental right. WHAT HAVE THE PETITIONED SAIDSenior counsel Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court last Wednesday that the Preamble to the Constitution intrinsically guarantees the right. He said that liberty, which is fundamental to a democracy, cannot exist without privacy.Senior counsel Arvind Datar argued that right to privacy flows from Article 14 (Right to Equality), Article 19 (Freedom of Expression) and Article 21 (Right to Life). Arguing for privacy as a fundamental right, Dattar said that the court must not strictly lay the right to privacy under a single article. Former Attorney General Soli Sorabjee , appearing in support of privacy right, said that even if the Constitution did not ""explicitly"" provide this right, it could be deduced as had been done in the case of freedom of press.WHAT HAS THE COURT SAID SO FARWhile hearing the petitioners, the Supreme Court observed that right to privacy cannot be absolute and the state may have powers to put reasonable curbs. The nine-judge Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice J S Khekar, comprises Justices J Chelameswar, S A Bobde, R K Agrawal, Rohinton Fali Nariman, Abhay Manohar Sapre, D Y Chandrachud, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and S Abdul Nazeer. ""We live in an age of big data and the state is entitled to regulate the data whether it is for the purpose of regulating crime, taxation or other activities... Right to privacy cannot be so absolute that it prevents the state from legislating or regulating it,"" the Constitution bench said.The Supreme Court also observed that ignorance of citizens on how personal data furnished by them was being used could not be the basis for not testing the validity of a law, in this case the Aadhaar Act.(With inputs from Anusha Soni and agencies) ALSO READ:Aadhaar vs WhatsApp: How privacy changes meaning for government in different cases "

He added, ""I've won this award with honesty. I have never cheated or made a call to anyone to win an award."" Akshay further said better late than never on his win.nn","He has given innumerable hits and some great performances in a career spanning over two decades, but has never won a national award. But it all changed for Akshay Kumar on Friday afternoon (April 7) when he won the national award for Best Actor for Rustom. Known to be a bankable actor, Akshay has become a favourite with fans and directors in the last few years. And his performance in 2016 film Rustom has won him his first national award. In an interview to Hindustan Times, Khiladi Kumar expressed his happiness over the national award win. He said, ""It is great news. National Film awards are the most prestigious awards in the country. It is a moment of pride for sure. The first reaction, honestly, was if this was a late April Fool's joke (laughs)! Actually, I am still trying to process this win, it is a mix of many emotions - surprise, happiness and, most prominently, gratitude to the jury, makers of the film, my parents and of course the beloved fans.""

Justice Manmohan termed the notification as ""arbitrary, unreasonable and against public interest."" The notification gave priority to people living within a radius of 1 kilometre from the school. ","The Delhi high court on Tuesday stayed a controversial nursery admission notification by the AAP government that made 298 private unaided schools, built on public land, to accept admission forms based only on the neighbourhood or distance criteria.Justice Manmohan termed the notification as ?arbitrary, unreasonable and against the public interest? before ordering a stay on its application on the private unaided schools for this year?s nursery admission process.Earlier, the court had directed the private schools to accept applications based on their own criteria as well as city administration guidelines. Tuesday?s order will give the schools a free hand to admit toddlers using their own criteria.?State cannot impose a restriction on choice of parents to choose a school for their wards just because it is beneficial for the child,? justice Manmohan remarked.Around 150,000 aspirants vie for 125,000 seats every year but the process gets caught in last-minute litigation as either parents or schools go to court almost every year.The court also questioned the city government?s decision to impose the neighbourhood restriction to only those schools that are built on Delhi Development Authority land.?Public interest cannot be confined to 298 schools,? justice Manmohan remarked adding, ?primary cause of nursery admission chaos is the lack of good schools in the capital?.The court?s order came on pleas by the Action Committee for Unaided Recognised Private Schools ? comprising more than 450 private unaided recognised schools in Delhi ? and the Forum for Promotion of Quality Education and some parents challenging the government?s January 7 notification.The notification gave priority to those living within a radius of 1 kilometre. In case seats remained vacant, those living within a 3-kilometre radius could get a chance. Which meant these schools could no longer deny admission to anyone from the neighbourhood.Earlier, the high court stayed city government?s controversial nursery admission notification that made it mandatory for private unaided minority schools to admit students, in the unreserved category, on the basis of neighbourhood criteria.The order gave relief to around 15 minority schools in the capital that were set up on public land."
Mansha Mahajan,06-2017,Nutella maker wins case against rival's false health claims ,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jun/19/belgium-palm-oil-nutella-ferrero-delhaize-court-battle-environmental-health-claims?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Slack ,A Belgian court has ruled that advertising claims about the health and environmental benefits of a palm oil-free 'Choco' spread by supermarket chain Delhaize were illegal. The case by Nutella manufacturer Ferrero argued that Delhaize's campaign unfairly damaged its iconic brand. Delhaize has now been ordered not to repeat claims about its spread being better for the planet or health.,"A Belgian court has ruled that advertising claims about the health and environmental benefits of a palm oil-free ?Choco? spread were illegal, in a case brought against the supermarket chain Delhaize by Ferrero, which manufactures Nutella.Delhaize has been ordered not to repeat any claims about its Choco spread being better for the planet or your health, on pain of a ?25,000 (Â£22,000) fine for each repetition.Ferrero argued that the Delhaize campaign unfairly damaged its iconic Nutella brand, which was placed next to the Choco spread on the supermarket?s shelves.Delhaize, which had won an earlier court case on the issue, told the Guardian it was considering further legal actions but would not appeal the verdict.At issue is a short-lived Delhaize advertising campaign in 2013, which claimed that the Belgian outlet?s best-selling Choco spread was better for the planet and for consumer health because it contained no palm oil. Ferrero argued this implied that firms which used sustainable practices for buying palm oil within existing supply chains were ethically inferior.Greenpeace, which in 2015 rated (pdf) Ferrero one of the best of 14 global manufacturers with ?no deforestation? policies, said the case had turned into a battle of sales strategies.?Ferrero is definitely one of the companies doing its best to implement sustainable commitments,? said An Lambrechts, a Greenpeace Belgium spokeswoman. ?This case is more about marketing ploys and market shares and less about who has the best initiative on palm oil.?Ferrero?s use of palm oil was pushed into the spotlight in 2015 after then-French environment minister SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal called for a consumer boycott of Nutella over deforestation concerns. Royal subsequently backed down from the call, offering the confectionery titan ?a thousand apologies?.Multiple studies (pdf) have drawn causal links between the growth of palm oil plantations in south-east Asia and deforestation but the court ruled that Delhaize?s claims were unverifiable.Ferrero has a robust palm oil charter and says it can trace almost all of its palm oil to sustainable sources. The company came top of a WWF sustainability league table of 137 palm oil buyers last year. It is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Palm Oil Innovation Group.?The court sustained Ferrero?s arguments that it is illegal to claim that a product without palm oil is de facto better for environment and has better nutritional qualities than one containing palm oil,? a spokesman for Ferrero said.?Ferrero has taken admirable steps to reduce the impact of palm oil within its supply chain,? said Glenn Hurowitz, the CEO of Mighty, which campaigns against deforestation caused by palm oil. ?But it is as yet impossible to delink one company?s supplies from the broader, continued deforestation of the palm oil industry as a whole.?A separate argument by Ferrero that Delhaize not be allowed to call their spread ?Choco? ? because it contains no chocolate ? was thrown out by the court.For its part, Delhaize said Choco was still being manufactured with sunflower oil, cocoa butter and coconut oil ? and packaged as palm oil-free.?We have not seen any impact on [Choco] sales. On the contrary,? said the firm?s communications director Roel Dekelver. ?Despite this judgement, we will continue to propose and present innovative and inspirational products to customers that answer their different needs. This won?t hold us back.? The Belgian supermarket, which merged with Ahold to create a ?40bn retail empire last year, had also alleged health benefits from palm-oil free produce, citing ?potential health concerns? from palm oil in an assessment by the European Food Safety Authority.However, this assessment also applied to other vegetable oils and products, and the analysis is currently being reassessed. Ian Barber, the communications director of the Advertising Association, said that the first rule of advertising was: ?If you can?t back up the claim, you can?t make it?. ?I?d imagine the strategy open to Delhaize now is just to advertise that they?re palm oil-free and leave world to make up its mind if that?s a good or a bad thing,? he said.

In his statement, Trump Jr said he discussed the adoption of Russian children with the lawyer who had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton.","Donald Trump personally dictated the press statement issued in the name of his eldest son Donald Jr that misleadingly downplayed the significance of a 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer, a new report alleged on Monday night.According to the Washington Post, Trump personally intervened to prevent senior White House advisers from issuing a full and truthful account of the meeting on 9 June 2016 in which Donald Trump Jr, the president?s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and then presidential campaign manager Paul Manafort came face-to-face with four Russians. One of the Russian visitors was the well-connected lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.The report, based on multiple though largely anonymous sources that included the president?s own advisers, has the potential to cause political, and even legal, trouble for the White House because it draws Trump himself much closer into the fray over the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a lightning rod in the Russian affair.Shunning the guidance of lawyers and overturning the view apparently reached by Kushner and his team of advisers that a full and frank accounting should be made, Trump reportedly dictated a statement on board Air Force One as he was flying back to Washington from the G20 summit in Germany. As would soon become apparent, it gave a very partial and distorted account of events.In the release the 2016 meeting was presented, in Trump?s own words, as ?a short introductory meeting? dominated by discussion of the adoption of Russian children that was ?not a campaign issue at the time?.That statement was presented to the New York Times on 8 July, and duly included in the newspaper?s first account of the meeting. But within 24 hours, highly damaging revelations had emerged that made clear the meeting had been much more charged than that.On 9 July, the Times revealed that Trump Jr had been lured into talking to Veselnitskaya by the promise of negative intelligence on his father?s presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and two days after that the email chain was published that showed the younger Trump reveling in the idea of receiving dirt on the Democratic presidential candidate, uttering the gleeful phrase: ?I love it?.The Trump Tower meeting has proved to be one of the most toxic pieces of information to emerge so far in the billowing investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia in the Kremlin?s efforts to skew the presidential outcome in favor of the Republican nominee. The special counsel leading the investigation, Robert Mueller, is understood to be looking closely at the event and has reportedly asked the White House to preserve all documents relating to it.Until now, the president managed to keep some distance from the 9 June encounter, with his lawyers claiming that he knew nothing about it. But the new report that Trump personally oversaw the issuing of a misleading account of the proceedings raises questions about the president?s role in what could be conceived as a cover-up.It comes as Mueller has already expanded his inquiry to include the issue of whether Trump was engaging in a possible obstruction of justice when he fired James Comey, having tried and failed to persuade the then director of the FBI to back off investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn?s contacts with Russian officials.A lawyer for the president issued the Washington Post with a curt statement: ?Apart from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent,? Jay Sekulow said.The new details of the president?s role in what turned out to be a major communications fiasco come on the day that his current communications chief, Anthony Scaramucci, was dismissed from the White House after barely 11 days. The blunt removal was made on the first day of the new White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who has vowed to introduce the kind of discipline that the West Wing has been sorely lacking.The day began shortly before 5.30am with Trump tweeting ?No WH chaos!? and ended with him saying: ?A great day at the White House?. But as the Washington Post?s forensic deconstruction of the framing of the Trump Tower meeting shows, the president himself has the capacity to destroy even the best-laid plans, underlining the task now facing his new chief of staff.According to the Post, senior White House officials together with the circle around Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, had spent days rehearsing various ways to address the Trump Tower meeting publicly.Kushner?s team was reported to have decided that it was better to ?err on the side of transparency? because the whole truth would eventually come out.Trump, however, appeared to have seen things differently."

However, the Uttar Pradesh government wants the Centre to fund this project, or at least share 50% of the ?2,000 crore amount with the state, YEIDA officials said. ","The Uttar Pradesh civil aviation department has written to the state government asking it to discuss the funding pattern of the ?Noida International Airport? at Jewar with the Centre at the earliest.The Union civil aviation ministry had on June 24 given its approval to build an international airport at Jewar. Now, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has sought Rs2,000 crore from the state government to acquire the initial 1,000 hectares of agricultural land for the project. On the whole, the project requires 5,000 hectares.YEIDA does not have the funds to begin land acquisition, and hence, requires financial help from the Uttar Pradesh (UP)?government, which wants the Centre to fund this project that needs an investment of a whopping Rs20,000 crore, according to officials of the YEIDA.?UP civil aviation department has suggested three options to funding land acquisition for the project. The first option is that the Centre gives Rs2,000 crore for land acquisition. The second is that UP and the Centre share 50% each of the Rs2,000 crore amount. The third option is that the YEIDA and the Airports Authority of India sign a memorandum of understanding to raise Rs200 crore, and raise the remaining Rs1,800 crore through loans,? said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, YEIDA.The YEIDA is facing a fund crunch as it owes Rs3,000 crore to various government bodies and banks. Immediately after approval of the Jewar airport project, it had written to the chief minister seeking funds to begin land acquisition. However, the state government wants the Centre?s help for it.?As per the third option, YEIDA and the Airports Authority of India will contribute Rs100 crore each so that the two can seek a loan of Rs1,800 crore. However, we do not want to fund Rs100 crore either. Now, the UP government will discuss these issues with the Central government and expedite the project,? said Singh.Officials at YEIDA said that issues between the state and Central governments regarding the funding pattern should be finalised at the earliest to fast-track the project. If these issues take a long time, then the project is bound to be delayed, they added.?We need to hire a private consultant to prepare a techno-feasibility study of the airport project. This study is crucial to take it to next stage. However, the consultant will be roped in only after funding pattern is finalised,? Singh said."

This is first set of major appointments by him since his elevation as head of the party on November 30.  Sources privy to the development said  Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), two Delhi MPs, and two former state unit chiefs  had played a major role in selecting names for  the coveted posts. Although Tiwari said the party had tried to strike a balance by accommodating each section of the society, there has been no representation of Dalit, minorities and women in the panel.Sources said out of 14, five names had strong RSS backing while eight names were recommended by two former Delhi BJP?heads.

Mishika Bangia,07-2017,Rajasthan University to teach Akbar's Haldighati's defeat,http://www.hindustantimes.com/education/akbar-defeated-in-haldighati-book-tweaking-history-might-be-included-in-rajasthan-university-s-ma-reading-list/story-SG7hLyW5kyGieVHLoWflFM.html?utm_source=inshorts&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=fullarticle ,"Rajasthan University is set to include a book on Mughal emperor Akbar's Haldighati's defeat by Rajput king Maharana Pratap in its History department's curriculum from this year. The book by Dr Chandra Shekhar Sharma projects Pratap as a great freedom fighter. Notably, the idea to teach Akbar's 'defeat' was first mooted by BJP MLA Mohan Lal Gupta earlier this year.","After the revision in class 10 schoolbooks, the University of Rajasthan?s (RU) history department is set to include a book that projects Rajput king Maharana Pratap as a victor in the 1576 Battle of Haldigati against Mughal emperor Akbar?s forces.Historical evidence shows that Pratap had fled the battlefield with more casualties on his side and later continued his guerrilla warfare against the Mughals. The dominant view about the battle so far has been in favour of the Mughal army.But those who dispute the dominant view, including the revised history schoolbook, say that the Mughal army?s failure in capturing or killing Maharana Pratap, its decision to not pursue Pratap?s army after he fled, and Akbar?s displeasure with his generals Man Singh and Asaf Khan prove that Pratap prevailed in the war.School education minister Vasudev Devnani had in March this year questioned Akbar?s victory asking why he attacked Mewar six times if he won the battle, and pronounced the Rajput king the victor.The history department of RU, in a meeting of its board of studies last month, decided to include Dr Chandra Shekhar Sharma?s Rashtra-Ratna Maharana Pratap in the list of recommended readings in the paper ?Rajasthan Through the Ages? in the second semester of MA History.Sharma?s book, according to the minutes of the meeting, has a fresh interpretation of Maharana Pratap, and projects him as a great freedom fighter, besides projecting him as a victor in the battle of Haldighati.The board also decided to include a topic ?Debate on the outcome of the Battle of Haldighati? in the topics to be covered under the paper. The university?s academic council subsequently approved the board?s decisions, which means students shall be studying the revised syllabus from this year onwards.The idea to teach Akbar?s ?defeat? in the university was first mooted by a BJP MLA Mohan Lal Gupta, also a member of the university?s syndicate, in a meeting of the syndicate in February this year.The MLA had suggested that a book ?Atit se Sakshatkar? by Onkar Singh Lakhawat and another one by Prof KS Gupta on the Haldighati battle be included in the syllabus.Lakhawat, however, wrote to the department that he has neither authored nor edited any book by that title. Prof Gupta too had not written any book on the topic but said he has written some research papers.After deliberations, the board felt ?there is a need to know the latest researches on Maharana Pratap and the battle of Haldighati?, and Dr Chandra Shekhar Sharma?s book was included in the syllabus.Under the BJP government in the state, several schoolbooks have been rewritten to promote its parent RSS?s saffron ideology. Hindutva ideologue Savarkar gained prominence while Nehru and Gandhi were relegated to periphery, and rival Congress was termed a ?nurtured baby? of the British, among other changes.BJP leaders have said that students were being taught ?distorted? versions of history earlier, and it was only bringing those leaders to the fore who were deliberately ignored by ?Communist? historians."

This comes after a female employee from the firm met IT Minister Priyank Kharge to bring up the matter, and the minister assured action after formal complaint.","On June 14, Manisha Kumari - an employee of IDC Technologies - told India Today that her office had denied cab facility to female employees working in the night shift.Manisha works as a technical recruiter in the IDC Technologies. She was aghast at the apathy of her company, which put safety of women employees at huge risk when they returned home late night from work. This was going for close to two months.India Today raised the matter with the IDC Technologies management as well as with the IT Minister of Karnataka Priyank Kharge, who promised to look into the matter. Priyank Kharge said the government would take action if Manisha filed a complaint as the act of IDC Technologies was in clear violation of the rules.IDC Technologies is a multinational company with operating centres in the US, Canada, Mexico and India.UNDER PRESSURE, IT FIRM PROMISES TO ABIDE BY RULESAs India Today raised the issue and exposed the IT firm for its blatant violation of the rules, the IDC Technologies felt pressure and decided to resume the cab facilities for female employees working in the night shift.The IT firm told India Today that they did not have cab facilities for their night shift female employees for about two months due to an issue with the cab vendor.Now, the matter has been resolved and all female employees working in the night shift will get a drop in till their home as per the existing rules.Praveen Kumar from the HR department of IDC Technologies told India Today that the company was now in compliance with Labour and IT laws of the state. ""Necessary action has been taken to make sure (that) all female employees working in the night shift are provided with pick-up and drop facilities. Employee satisfaction is our main motto and female employee safety is our prime concern,"" Praveen Kumar added. The company has now deployed six cabs that pick and drop their female employees working in the night shift.HOW MANISHA FOUGHT FOR HER RIGHTThough the IDC Technologies maintains that the cab problem was there for only two months, Manisha told India Today that the issue has been dragging for nearly two years.She told India Today that the night shift earlier started at 6.30 pm and continued till 3.30 am when the employees would log out and leave for home. But, in the absence of cab facility, it became quite unsafe for female employees, Manisha said.After some of the employees complained of being harassed in those hours while they went back home, the timings were changed to 7.30 pm to 4.30 am. But, this did not solve the safety problem, said Manisha, who recounted three incidents of harassment on the way back home since she joined the IT firm in February.""Once I was harassed by a cab driver near the Silk Board Junction who misbehaved with me when I was leaving work and another time by two bike borne men. The third incident involved a passerby,"" Manisha said. Manish further said that when she brought these incidents to the notice of the tech company, the vice president said that the company was responsible for their safety only while they were working and not after they logged out.Manisha had met the IT Minister Priyank Kharge to narrate the state of affairs on June 14, when she was assured of help. The Minister also promised that ""if companies flout rules, we will take action."" According to amended the Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1961 and the Factories Act 1948, the companies are responsible for providing pick up and drop in facilities to female employees working during night time.ALSO READ | "

The number of foreign tourists visiting the state decreased by 10-15% while the number of domestic tourists dipped by 20-30%. The fall is in contrast to the increase in the numbers before demonetisation, the government added. ","Minister Thiruvananthapuram, Jan 3 (PTI) Keralas tourism sector has registered an estimated loss of about Rs 1,000 crore, following a dip in the arrival of foreign and domestic tourists since the Centre announced demonetisation of high-value currencies, the state government said today. The cash crunch has severely affected the sector and the loss was estimated to be about Rs 1,000 crore since the demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes came into effect from November 8 last, state Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran told a press conference here. There was a decrease of 10-15 per cent in the number of foreign tourists arriving while the number of domestic tourists dipped by 20-30 per cent, he added. The fall in arrival of tourists was ""in contrast"" to an increase in the numbers of both foreign and domestic tourists before demonetisation, the minister said. He pointed out that the state netted a revenue of Rs 25,000 crore every year from the tourism sector. ""The currency crunch arose during the tourism season itself and so, things went wrong to a great extent,"" Surendran said, adding that foreign tourists were not getting enough cash at airports on their arrival. Even though several complaints were received in this regard, due to the Centres ""adamant"" attitude, the state was not able to do anything, he claimed. Tourists were also spending very little money in the state now which had affected the local traders, said Surendran. The houseboat business, one of the main attractions of backwater tourism in Kerala, was ""on the verge of collapse"", he said and added that the state government would do ""everything possible"" to boost the tourism sector.

The sticker will indicate the vehicle's age, engine and its cleanliness. France also extended its ""superbonus scheme"", where owners could receive ?10,000 (?7.14 lakh) for changing their polluting vehicle for an electric one.","French motorists in high pollution areas will be required to display a ?clean sticker? on their vehicle from January to combat pollution that has created a cloud of noxious smog in Paris and other cities.The six differently coloured Crit?Air (air criteria) stickers will be large enough for the police to see at a distance and will indicate the age of the vehicle, its engine and cleanliness on a scale of one to six.Although emergency vehicles, vintage cars and certain delivery and security vans will be exempt from the regulation, to take effect from 16 January, stickers will be obligatory for motorbikes and scooters.On weekdays, vehicles without the stickers will be banned from entering designated zones Ã  circulation restreinte (ZCR - low-emission zones), which will be determined by local authorities based on pollution evaluations.Announcing a raft of measures to combat the increasing problem of pollution in France?s cities, the ecology minister, SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal, said the government was ?taking the problem seriously?.?What we now need is a revolution bringing clean transport, responsible cities, electric vehicles in cities and different ways of moving around,? Royal said.The alternating traffic rule ? in which cars with odd or even registration plates are banned from cities ? was enforced for a record four days in Paris last week. It was dropped after the pollution improved over the weekend when the roads were less busy. But Airparif, which monitors air quality in the French capital, warned that the smog, which led to a rise in asthma and hospital admissions for breathing difficulties and caused schools to cancel outdoor sports, could return with the rush-hour traffic on Monday.Other measures announced include an extension of the ?superbonus scheme? in which vehicle owners can obtain a ?10,000 (Â£8,400) payment for changing an old polluting vehicle for an electric one. Until now this has been offered to private car owners but is to be extended to taxis and vans.From January, the government will also offer ?1,000 to those buying an electric scooter.The Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, who has made fighting pollution in the city a priority, has declared she wants the capital free of diesel vehicles by 2020 and the whole of France by 2025."

Speaking after a day of bilateral discussions at the G20 summit in Hamburg, the prime minister said the UK had led on bolstering the global fight against terror and modern slavery as well as pushing for the implementation of the Paris agreement and boosting international trade.On terrorism, Theresa May repeated past calls for world leaders to do more to disrupt international finance streams for terror groups and to help stop foreign fighters returning to the west from conflicts in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. She also said the G20 agreed to do more to combat domestic violent extremism and welcomed moves from technology companies to address the online spread of extremist content.The prime minister went on to describe modern slavery and trafficking as the ?great human rights issue of our time? and highlighted the UK?s taskforce to combat the issue. She said more needed to be done around thew world and called for a ?radically new global approach? to stopping human traffickers. On the Paris Agreement, the most contentious issue of the summit, May said she was ?dismayed? at the US decision to leave the pact. She urged Trump to rejoin it and said, following questions, that she had pushed the US president to do so in conversations during the Hamburg meeting. May went on to say she was a leading advocate of free trade but admitted some had been ?left behind? by globalisation - an admission she has made repeatedly in the past. She said the UK had pushed for G20 leaders to stop steel dumping practices and to do more to economically empower women. The prime minister added that the UK would work with others to improve international trading systems and to ensure more job opportunities for women. Linking her bilateral meetings to the Brexit process, May said she looked forward to agreeing trade deals with ?new friends and old partners?. Asked about a visit from one of the UK?s oldest partners, the US, May said no date had been agreed for Trump?s arrival in London.

Vladimir Putin said he had established a working relationship with US president Donald Trump, speaking at a press conference as the G20 summit draws to a close.The Russian president said thought there were grounds to believe at least partial cooperation with Washington could be achieved. Putin said he felt Trump had accepted Putin?s assertions that Moscow had not interfered in the US presidential election last year, but that it was best to ask Trump what his views on that were. He said the two leaders at their meeting had agreed to work together on cyber security and said he thought Trump in reality was a different person from the one seen on TV.Putin said Trump had asked him detailed questions regarding allegations that Moscow had interfered in last year?s US election. He said he had tried to give Trump detailed answers which he said seemed to satisfy his counterpart.The new ceasefire deal in southern Syria was the result of the United States altering its stance and becoming more pragmatic about the situation there, Putin said.He also said that certain pre-cursors had been created for an improvement in relations between Moscow and Washington going forward.

While climate change could not be agreed on, officials did reach a common statement including Trump about the other contentious issue at the summit, trade. However Merkel said discussions on subject with the US had been particularly difficult. The statement retains the G20?s longstanding rejection of protectionism. But it also acknowledged that trade must be mutually beneficial and that countries can use ?legitimate? trade defenses to protect workers and industries against being taken advantage of by trade partners.Merkel reiterated her statement that Europeans have to take their fate ?in their own hands,? saying that while cooperation with the US is important, some topics like trade, steel in particular, are ?difficult? to discuss with the Americans.

In a press conference, Angela Merkel said world leaders have agreed their final communique at the G20 summit.She said 19 members of the Group of 20 have reaffirmed the Paris climate accord as ?irreversible.?She made clear that it had been very difficult to get a consensus and in the end, breaking from tradition, a separate paragraph was included to cover the position of the US, who are withdrawing from the Paris climate change agreement and wanted fossil fuels to be mentioned. The German chancellor said the declaration makes absolutely clear that is not the common position of the other 19 world leaders. Merkel said there had been no compromise on climate change and called the US position ?regrettable?.She said: ?We amended the declaration and it says very clearly what the United States of America want and underneath what the other countries want.?The German chancellor said she ?deplored? the decision by the US to withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, but said that all other nations agree Paris climate accord is irreversible.Here is the controversial section of the G20 communique:We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The United States of America announced it will immediately cease the implementation of its current nationally-determined contribution and affirms its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs. The United States of America states it will endeavour to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently and help deploy renewable and other clean energy sources, given the importance of energy access and security in their nationally determined contributions. Directly following that paragraph is this one, as Merkel said in her press conference:The Leaders of the other G20 members state that the Paris Agreement is irreversible. We reiterate the importance of fulfilling the UNFCCC commitment by developed countries in providing means of implementation including financial resources to assist developing countries with respect to both mitigation and adaptation actions in line with Paris outcomes and note the OECD?s report ?Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth?. We reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris Agreement, moving swiftly towards its full implementation in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances and, to this end, we agree to the G20 Hamburg Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth as set out in the Annex.

Trump has promised $639 million in funding for humanitarian programmes, including $331 million to help feed starving people in four famine-hit countries - Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria and Yemen. The US president?s pledge came during a working session of the G20 summit of world leaders in Hamburg, providing a ?godsend? to the UN World Food Programme, the group?s executive director, David Beasley, told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting.?We?re facing the worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two,? said Beasley, a Republican and former South Carolina governor who was nominated by Trump to head the world?s largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide. He said the additional funding was about a third of what the agency estimated was required this year to deal with urgent food needs in the four countries facing famine and in other areas. The WFP estimates that 109 million people around the world will need food assistance this year, up from 80 million last year, with 10 of the 13 worst affected zones stemming from wars and ?man-made? crises, Beasley said. ?We estimated that if we didn?t receive the funding we needed immediately that 400,000 to 600,000 children would be dying in the next four months,? he said. Trump?s announcement came after his administration proposed sharp cuts in funding for the US State Department and other humanitarian missions as part of his ?America First? policy. Beasley said the agency had worked hard with the White House and the U.S. government to secure the funding, but Trump would insist that other countries contributed more as well. A WPF spokesman said Germany recently pledged an additional 200 million euros for food relief.The United States has long been the largest donor to the WFP."

The Supreme Court has passed an order vacating an earlier High Court judgement which had put on hold a National Green Tribunal's order asking the bodies to pay the fine to restore the river.","Two municipal bodies and an association of industries will have to pay Rs96 crore for polluting the Ulhas River in Thane, after the Supreme Court vacated a Bombay high court order that had put on hold the penalty.On July 5, the SC passed an order staying the HC judgement, which had put on hold a 2015 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order. The NGT had asked the municipal bodies and association to pay the fine. The SC order, which was made public on Monday, effectively stays all previous orders of the HC in this matter.The SC said the civic bodies and the industries have the option of either filing a review in the NGT or taking the matter to the SC itself, within three weeks.In July 2015, the western bench of the NGT had passed a judgement indicting the Dombivli Industries Association (DBESA), Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation, Ambernath Municipal Council and the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation of polluting the Ulhas River with untreated effluents and raw sewage. The judgment imposed a penalty of Rs96 crore to restore the river and ordered that a time-bound revival plan be put in place.READ:  Unfazed by censure, Maharashtra?s polluting factories make its rivers filthiest in IndiaThe matter came to light three years earlier in 2012, when NGO Vanashakti filed a petition with the NGT, asking it to direct the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to shut polluting industries discharging untreated waste into the Ulhas River, as it violates environment rules. Following the NGT order in July 2015, the government agencies moved the HC, which stayed the tribunal?s order of depositing the amount, and constituted another committee above the one formed by the tribunal. The current SC order was in light of a special leave petition filed by Vanashakti in the SC, challenging the HC?s decision. ?We find no reasonable ground to entertain such apprehension (by the HC),? read the order by the SC bench of justice Arun Mishra and justice Amitava Roy. ?The impugned order is set aside... The appeals stand disposed of.??We are relieved that years of hard work have not gone down the drain and we are deeply thankful to the SC for intervening,? said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. ?The judicial delays were giving polluters a long rope and destroying the river. The pollution control boards failed their duty, and it led to a pristine river becoming polluted.? A senior official from Ulhasnagar corporation said government agencies will approach SC. ?We will ask for relief from penalty as we have begun restoring the river and a revival plan is in place,? he said"

Pakistan had earlier called it a violation of international treaties.","India on Sunday hoisted the tallest tricolour in the country at the Attari border. The 360-foot tall flag is high enough to be spotted from Lahore in Pakistan. Hoisted on a 110-meter high mast, the flag is 120-foot long and 80-foot wide. The weight of the flag pole is 55 tonnes, and an estimated Rs 3.50 crore rupees have been spent on this project by the Punjab government.Before this, the title of the tallest national flag in India belonged to a 293-foot-high tricolour that was hoisted in Jharkhand's Ranchi.

I am political. I make my statement. I have political ideologies. I settle for what could be good for the people because they have the mandate to choose their leader. I am one of them. I don't want my way all the way.""5. On Sasikala being an interloper in corruption case: ""They are all there...It's a conglomeration of corruption. Let's not pinppoint a lady."" 6.

Masi Sadaiyan and Vaidivel Gopal, both in their 50s, from the Irula tribe of Tamil Nadu, are successful python hunters in India, and were brought in, along with two translators, to work with detection dogs earlier this month to track down and capture the giant snakes.

The FWC and UF/IFAS have been collaborating with public land managers to identify environmentally sensitive areas that would benefit most from targeted python removal. Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge is one such area because of the federally-endangered Key Largo woodrat and many protected bird species that reside there. "

Officials have identified 12 points in Meghalaya and one in Assam along the border where fences would be pulled down to build gates. The initiative would also permit transboundary movement of elephant rescue teams.,"Illegal migrants from Bangladesh entering India is a contentious issue between both neighbours. While New Delhi contends large-scale influx from across the border, Dhaka has denied these migrants are their citizens.There was no such difference though when officials of both nations agreed on Thursday to construct gates along the border to allow ?free and safe passage? for wild elephants.Setting up of the gates was one of the 18 points of action agreed between both countries at the 2nd Indo-Bangladesh dialogue on trans-boundary conservation of elephants held at Shillong.?Trans-border migration of animals is a natural process. But due to erection of border fences, there have been occasions when elephants have broken barriers to continue on their route. The gates will allow them safe passage,? India?s director general of forest Siddhanta Das told HT.Officials have identified 12 points in Meghalaya and one in Assam along the border, which are used by wild elephants to travel to Bangladesh, where the gates will be constructed.It is estimated nearly 20 pachyderms from India move to Bangladesh annually around winter and return later.?We will be tracking these animals and use the services of security and forest personnel on both sides of the border to ensure that the elephants don?t face any problems,? said Das.Construction of the gates, which would require cutting of border fencing between both countries at some points, is expected to be over before the 3rd round of the dialogue on the issue in Dhaka next year.Both countries also agreed to discourage and regulate construction of electric fences to protect crops in the areas which fall in the routes taken by the elephants to prevent deaths due to electrocution.Measures to prevent or bring down incidents of human-elephant conflict while the pachyderms crisscross between both countries, such as setting up warning systems and planting of trees to act as bio-fence, were also discussed.There are nearly 9,000 wild elephants in the northeast region, around 1800 of them in Meghalaya alone, and sometimes they venture to Bangladesh in search of food or mates.Last year, a wild elephant was swept away to Bangladesh by the flooded waters of Brahmaputra from Dhubri in Assam. The animal, named Banga Bahadur by people in Bangladesh, died after 50 days of efforts between two countries to bring it back."

Except, this isn?t.Lipstick Under My Burkha is a simple story about four women and their dreams - of financial independence, of becoming a singer, of moving to a big city and of simply, enjoying life. The fact that these desires remain hidden from the society makes their desires seem like adventurous trips. Lipsticks, in the film, are these desires while the patriarchal society is the Burkha. The film does not loudly cheer feminism or as CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani calls it, ?lady-oriented?. Alankrita chooses a subtle narrative style to tell us the stories of four different women who are fighting a male chauvinist society and mindset. And therein lies the beauty of Lipstick Under My Burkha which is set in a small town. Alankrita shows a very relatable and authentic Bhopal in her movie and her characters are all realistic. They have their own set of small, yet, irritating problems dealing with the male-dominated society.Shireen (Konkona) is a housewife who works a salesgirl but needs to hide her job from her husband (Sushant). Bua jee aka Usha (Ratna) is a 55-year-old woman rendered devoid of desires because of her age but enjoys reading soft porn hidden in her religious books. Leela (Aahana) is a free-spirited woman who feels suffocated in the small town of Bhopal and uses her sexuality to manipulate the men in her life. Rihanna (Plabita) is a young college girl who idolises Miley Cyrus and wants to follow her fashion style. She has to hide her desires of a becoming a singer under a burkha, thanks to her orthodox parents. Every character in the film deals with different kinds of prejudices and restrictions but eventually, they prove to be the same - curbing the freedom of women. The small town setting enables the four characters to be part of each others? lives and eventually come together.Lipstick Under My Burkha is no didactic piece on how women should be treated, neither is it an all-out-war against patriarchy. The film is a subdued conversation starter - let us talk about women?s desires as well as their rights, let women open up about their dreams.Lipstick under my Burkha brings in a lot of issues - from dictates on women?s clothing to forced sex in a marriage, it addresses all of them boldly. This is a bold film not because it talks of women?s sexuality but because it draws attention to their desires and problems and does so in the most glaring colours. Alankrita has an army of wonderful actors to support her engaging movie. Be it Sushant, Konkona, Plabita, Ratna, Vikrant or Aahana, all of them belong to their characters and are impressive. This is one of those rare films in which it is difficult to pick a favourite but Konkona?s performance rises among them as she is the one who is not dependent on others to fulfil her desires. Not to complain about others? dreams as they simply happen to be such that cannot be completed without others? help. It is laughable that the CBFC had problems with such a light film that merely talks about women nurturing their own desires that cross the boundaries of a male-dominated society. While the final scene of the film might work for some,I would have loved it had it been more decisive. A closure to the narratives would have provided for a more positive and optimistic cinema, what Lipstick Under My Burkha aims to be. This is a film you must not miss as it is not everyday that Bollywood films talk of women and their desires.Follow @htshowbiz for more"

The circular was withdrawn through a one-line order issued late in the evening by the UT?s department of personnel and administrative reforms.?The circular is ridiculous.

The RSS is the ideological parent of the ruling BJP.Last year, women ministers in the Modi government went to the border areas to celebrate the festival with soldiers. A year before, all cabinet ministers were asked to go to their constituencies for the festival."

Abhishek Bansal,03-2017,Bill to increase Parliament sittings to 100 days tabled,http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/naresh-gujral-private-member-bill-100-days-parliament-sittings/1/912088.html ,"A Private Member's Bill has been tabled in the Rajya Sabha which seeks to ensure that the Parliament meets for at least 100 days every year. The bill, submitted by Shiromani Akali Dal MP Naresh Gujral, also calls for special sessions for fifteen days to discuss two issues of utmost public importance. Currently, the Parliament meets for 70-80 days annually.","At a time when public cynicism about the country's parliamentarians is at an all time high, there is one MP, who believes that the members of Parliament need to work much harder.He is Naresh Gujral, the Akali Dal MP in the Rajya Sabha. Gujral believes that Parliament needs to meet more often than it does now. Gujral has tabled a private member's Bill, the Parliament Enhancement of Productivity Bill, asking for Parliament to must meet at least for 100 days a year.The Bill could not have come at a more opportune moment. Adjournments are fast becoming a norm rather than an aberration. Complete sessions have been washed out without transacting any business inside the Houses and outside a Shiv Sena MP has made the news for beating up an Air India official.Gujral's Bill, if adopted by the government, could go some distance in not only making Parliament a lot more productive but it will also help redeem the MPs in the eye of the public.WHY THE BILL IS SIGNIFICANTIn addition to making it mandatory for Parliament to sit at least for a hundred days a year, spread over four sessions, it also calls for the convening of a special session of both houses for fifteen days. The special session as envisaged by Gujral will not have either the question hour or the zero hour but will be devoted exclusively to taking up two issues of utmost public importance. It has a provision for each political party submitting at least two issues before the business advisory committee that it wants to be taken up in the special session.Significantly at a time when both Houses of Parliament are routinely adjourned or unable to transact any business on account of disruptions. The bill has a provision for compensating the hours lost due to disruptions by adding it to the number of hours that the Houses must sit to make up for the disruptions. Gujral's Bill is silent on the need to deprive the MP's of their allowances on the days that the house is adjourned due to disruptions."

						The marital declaration form had been in existence since the inception of the institute in 1983. Some officials blamed the faux pas on poor translation on the part of individuals who drafted the document.?The word ?virgin? mentioned on the form had nothing to do with the virginity of any employee. It only sought to know the employees? marital status, so their dues could be settled on the basis of their declaration in the event of death while in service,? said Dr Mandal."
